0.0,I painfully made it through the whole movie. It is now on the top ten worst movie list. I found it boring and annoying. The acting resembled something you'd watch with a homemade movie but quite possibly worse. I do not recommend this movie for anyone.
0.0,It's as bad as the reviews indicate. I laughed once. The charisma of the two stars is completely wasted.
0.0,"This film is absolutely terrible. The script is awful, and so are the performances. There isn't even a single funny moment. Skip this one at all costs!"

0.0,"I only saw the first 10 minutes of this movie, but that was such a sad experience I had to turn it off. A waste of Witherspoon's talent. Wish I could give this 0 stars."
1.0,Reese and Sofia did amazing in this movie
0.0,It's a female buddy road trip picture and it's terrible. Sofia Vergara's amazing melons are about the only thing worth watching and even they can't redeem this shitslopper. Don't waste your time.
0.0,Really bad version of the heat
1.0,"loved, loved, loved it.Those two together are so hilarious. I would watch it a million Times and laugh beginning to end each time."
0.0,"Hot Pursuit is like a really long, egregiously unfunny SNL skit. Reese Witherspoon was just nominated for an Oscar for Wild. Watch that movie instead. Steer VERY CLEAR of Hot Pursuit. It's not worth it."
0.0,The best part was when the ex-Eastenders actor appeared
0.0,"This is one of the worst comedies I've seen this year, and it's definitely one of the worst movies I've seen this year! 0.5/5 stars."
0.0,This movie is a waste of your time and money. STAY AWAY
0.0,"This is exactly what you do not want to see in a female comedy. With the ""humor"" rooted in depicting women doing things women do not traditionally, there is a limit on what can be seen as funny. Hot Pursuit finds this limit almost immediately."

1.0,"People need to calm down and just laugh! I have never laughed so hard during a movie! Me an my friend both agree it was hilarious. Not every movie has to be Oscar worthy, sometimes it's fun to laugh at goofy comedy. Stop analyzing and have fun! That's what this movie is about."
0.0,"Possibly the worst tripe I have had the displeasure of watching this year. The jokes do not work, the chemistry between the leads feels forced and flat! The script and plot are god awful ..:: avoid like the plague"
0.0,bad don't waste your time
0.0,Terrible movie. I'll never get the time back I just wasted watching it.
0.0,A candidate for worst film in 2015. Reese Witherspoon and Sofia Vegara do a lot of acting in this over-the-top attempt at comedy. Too bad it is the wrong kind of acting. There are painfully unfunny scene after scene and the actresses are embarrassing to watch.
0.0,Not that many funny parts . Sad movie and a waste of money.

0.0,Not funny. Run as far away as you possibly can.
0.0,save yourself the trouble and sit in a hot bath with some candles for an hour.
0.0,"Hot Pursuit is supposedly an action comedy film, although it is far from both, as this film offers little to no laughs at all, and completely mediocre action scenes. Reese Witherspoon's voice alone is somewhat cringeworthy, although her opposite, Sofia Vergara, does her best to deliver."
1.0,This movie made me continually laugh!!
0.0,Armed and sort of dangerous.
0.0,A horrible way to spend 84 minutes. Simply devoid of laughs or smiles or producing anything that isn't a frown. I pray that Witherspoon's career never sinks as low as this again and that this is removed from screens as soon as possible to prevent further torture.
0.0,One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Both leads seem forced and trying to hard to be funny. Struggled to watch it to the end
0.0,Hot Pursuit is a painfully unfunny film. It is a bad ripoff of The Heat. None of the jokes land and the plot is very predictable. This is a poor movie that you shouldn't watch.
0.0,"Not that I say a Oscar nominees shouldn't take a comedy, but this is the kind of movie so called ""the script write funny""."
0.0,"This movie is pretty bad. Didn't even get to the end, and have no intention of trying to."

0.0,Contender for worst movie in history?
0.0,"It really is your typical Cop+Fugitive Road Trip story, with some attempts at comedy thrown in. We've seen this tired tale flop on the big screen countless times before, and Hot Pursuit is no different. The movie was headed for the gutter as soon as it began."

0.0,How bad was this movie? REALLY FREAKIN BAD.
0.0,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. The only scene I loved in the movie was when Christopher Walken was in the one scene. Christopher Walken was the only redeeming factor. Apart from his scene, the rest of the movie is crap."
0.0,Definitely as bad as advertised. I don't buy Affleck and Lopez has mob enforcer and the dialogue is AWFUL. Only watch this to remind yourself what truly bad movies are.

0.0,si hubiera menos una estrella seria esa su calificaci車n
1.0,"Love this movie, one of the best of the 21st century."
0.0,"Not as bad as you've heard, but close, with obnoxious characters (Affleck is particularly annoying) and a very poor script. Kazan, Walken and Pacino provide the film with its only bright moments, relatively speaking, but even they can help this turkey."
0.0,"Wildly acclaimed as one of worst movies of all time, it unfortunately lives up to it's lack of hype."
0.0,I tried watching this. I really did. Beyond awful does not even begin to capture this thing.
0.0,Some of the worst dialogue ever written for a movie.
0.0,"Another film that doesn't allow a 0 star rating system. This film was the ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" of It's time, except Plan 9 was classic..."
0.0,I'm glad affleck rose above this. His acting in this movie was some of the worst I've ever seen.
0.0,A career ending movie!
0.0,When people say this is one of the worst movies of all time .... believe them.
0.0,One of the only Ben Affleck movies I hate. It was pretty bad. There were a few good one-liners but mostly it was crap.
0.0,"I saw this movie because it had such a bad reputation. It is the worst movie, not just in the history of cinema, but also the worst piece of drama, since the dawn of time. I gave it half a star because in came in a DVD case........."
0.0,The things you have heard about this film are true.
0.0,As bad as its reputation would lead you to believe.
0.0,I am a Ben Affleck fan so reviewing this beyond a star rating would be cruel.
0.0,My most hated film of all time.
0.0,Is there a way to give this a 1/4 a star?
0.0,Horrible Horrible Horrible movie. Her lecture about why the vagina is lovely is the dumbest scene in the movie.
1.0,"this movie rocks! to call it a movie would be an insult to its sheer brilliance and cinematic prowess, this is the definition of a true film, on par with some of the greatest films of the modern era"
0.0,"Ridiculous in its premise, vomit inducing in its sentimentality and everyone involved should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves. It's like the screen plays for Chasing Amy and Midnight Run we're spliced together by someone on Ketamine."
0.0,This movie was horrible.
0.0,One of the worst movies I've ever seen.
0.0,"...If you don't think this movie is a horrifying, brutal, torture-filled experience, you haven't seen it...but please don't for the love of God ever see it"
0.0,One Word :eeeeeaaaaooooouuuueeeeaaaaaaaguuuuuuuraaaaaghhhh!
0.0,movie fucking sucks.
0.0,"Incredibly stupid and surprisingly bad movie, I actually think Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez are great actors/actresses but they deserve a whole lot better than this piece of crap."
0.0,"Where Ben Afleck once was and JLo still is. This is the type movie that should be banned from being released. This movie gets a half star since I am sure Ben got him some a**, so you can't blame they guy."
0.0,"Yeah, I needed to try a viewing because I felt a little bad for it. Until I watched it."
0.0,Hahaha! The part where they have sex WITH CLOTHES is so funny!!The only good thing of this movie is the performance of Justin Bartha.

0.0,"I finally checked out this movie, and it did not disappoint, it was horrible. Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez were miscast and the dialogue was extremely painful: ""gobble, gobble."" The scenes with Walken and Pacino were like scenes from some other movie spliced into this one."
0.0,Probably the worst movie ever made. Pediod.
0.0,"""It's Turkey Time... Gobble Gobble""  Quite possibly the worst line of dialogue ever uttered on-screen."
0.0,one of the worst movies ever!!!! painful and insulting to sit through. no wonder lopez's and affleck's career are in the crapper. can you believe al pacino was in this? plus it was directed by the dude who made scent of a woman. something went wrong here.
1.0,It'll change your life.
0.0,"Truly awful. I watched it thinking that it can't be as bad as it was made out to be, but it was! Terrible story, awful acting, woeful dialogue, I could go on and on but I'll cut it short, simply because if I don't I'll go in to detail on why every scene if abysmal."
0.0,It's films like these that make me question why the stars were stars to begin with. A thin story fueled by a mediastorm we remember as Bennifer. It's a shame that good money was thrown down the rabbit hole on garbage like that.
1.0,"It may not be the best of Affleck and Lopez's movies, but just such a crack up"
0.0,Can't speak... so evil.... repressed memories of BLEUGH!

1.0,HILARIOUS... even if unintended.
0.0,"Quite worthy of all the scorn heaped upon it. Incredibly lame. One thing that baffles me though: you can imagine z-grade actors like Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez being in something this crap, but what the hell were Al Pacino and Christopher Walken thinking?"
1.0,"Although I never saw it, I would have to put it on my movies of the decade for the sole reason that it united us in a strong dislike of Ben Afleck."
0.0,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!
0.0,I hate the fact that Al Pacino was in this horrific movie.

0.0,"So horrifyingly bad, it's entertaining"
0.0,The one good thing about this is that it more or less ended Ben Affleck's career.
0.0,I can't believe someone trusted either of these two with monologues!!!!
1.0,Watched it with no sound. Jenniger Lopez is hot.

0.0,honestly. the WORST movie ive ever seen.

0.0,"Dear god, what the hell was that?"
0.0,"I'm not really sure where to start with this one...I suppose that this movie will prove to Hollywood that attaching attractive ""actors"" to a bullshit movie won't make it a hit."
0.0,Oh My God! I'd rather watch vomit congeal!

0.0,"I hated it. Ben Affleck's character was absolutely irredeemable. The acting was fine, I just hated the plot and the characters. I found Afleck's character completely offensive."
0.0,possibly the worst film i ever half assed watched
0.0,"This movie is one example that both Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez can't act. This movie didn't suck because they were dating, it suced because they are pretty bad actors."
0.0,"Shitness from go to whoa. A hitman falling in love with a lesbian assassin? Dear god, HELP US ALL! And to think they wanted to get married in real life. Truly tragic stuff."

0.0,This movie requires negative stars!!!
0.0,This isn't THE worst movie ever...but when I saw this on T.V I realized it was really awkward. Part of the reason why a lot of people dislike Gigli is because of Benifer. They were an awful couple.

0.0,This movie turned me off of Benifer forever
0.0,"this was terrible, but it's just a bit better than ""the worst movie ever"" like most people say."
0.0,"If I could give zero stars, I would. This is an insult to film as an art. There is no coherent plot, the dialogue is dreadful and offensive, and the soundtrack sounds like the rejected B-sides from The Lion King 2. I actually felt physically ill watching only 1 hour of it."
0.0,"Terrible terrible movie. We all know how bad Jennifer Lopex and Ben Affleck are, but the really sad part is watching Al Pacino getting involved in this kind of outright crap."
0.0,Bennifer never sunk so low. Their onscreen chemistry was lukewarm at most. I can't believe that they were an item in real life you don't believe it on screen. We could also have used maybe some plot or storyline any would do.

1.0,"pretty blatant racism & american nationalist agenda aside, this is a remarkably well-made film."
