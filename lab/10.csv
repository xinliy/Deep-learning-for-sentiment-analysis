1.0,rio_bravo,"Good versus evil, feelgood movie."

1.0,rio_bravo,"If you only see one Western ever, you might want to make it this one. The actors are all superb and the story, while simple, is compelling. In so many ways this is the model for so many Westerns that came after it (together with films like High Noon)."
1.0,rio_bravo,The best Western from the classic times by far! My favorite John Wayne western of all time.

1.0,rio_bravo,classic hawks john wayne vehicle
1.0,rio_bravo,This is one of my favorite westerns. Not only John Wayne and Dean Martin star in it but so dose Angie Dickinson. Its very similar to El Dardo thoe. But I gusse it was just so amazing the first time the had to make it agine.
1.0,rio_bravo,the cowboy flick to end all cowboy flicks.dean martin is drunk. john wayne is a stand up guy. ricky nelson sings. chyea.
0.0,rio_bravo,"John Wayne should've realized that when you make a film in response to another movie that the movie you're making has to be better than the film you're responding to. Horribly acted, horribly directed, horribly written. 1 star! High Noon is a masterpiece!!!"
1.0,rio_bravo,love this movie it is my husband fav movie it also grew on me
1.0,rio_bravo,"Rio Bravo is probably one of the best Westerns ever made. Wayne is so cool,but its Dean Martin as the drunk who shines for me."
1.0,rio_bravo,i love this movie with guys like John Wayne and Ricky Nelson i also like Dean Martin in this one he plays a good drunk but thats not the only reason i like this movie.Its a really good movie with a great cast in it.
1.0,rio_bravo,"What a cast, a great story and the songs are memorable...one of my top 10"
1.0,rio_bravo,"The most watchable Western of all time. A great buddy movie, a great shoot-em up, a great character study. Howard Hawks puts together the greatest Western/action team of all time with Wayne, Martin, Nelson, Dickinson, and Brennan."
1.0,rio_bravo,John Wayne underplays his character and lets Dean Martin take over in an often overlooked roll. The cast of characters are steadfast western favorites with just enough levity and seriousness to make this a fantastic move beginning to end.
1.0,rio_bravo,the duke kickin but and letting some woman tell him what he feel's

1.0,rio_bravo,"Angie Dickenson was the only negative in this movie. She was stiff and uninteresting, then again, maybe I was jealous??? Also, I was watching this movie at the very moment Ricky Nelson's plane was crashing, resulting in his death. :-("
1.0,rio_bravo,Cowboys + shootouts + singing + Classic western characters in non-classic situations = Howard Hawks' best movie
1.0,rio_bravo,This is a very good movie

1.0,rio_bravo,Every potential US immigrant should be forced to watch this western and then quizzed afterward
1.0,rio_bravo,"This is John Wayne's finest movie that has the Duk,e in his best role: a sheriff. The story is greatly told and fits the age rather well. Not many other Western films come close to this one's calm but dangerous nature"
1.0,rio_bravo,"A great story, especially when you realize it really is Dude's story, one of redemption...also great script. The new DVD, plus extras is excellant. Inspiration for the original Assault on Precint 13...by Carpenter."

1.0,rio_bravo,Y 'a rien de mieux au monde. Promis.
1.0,rio_bravo,"It's actually a romantic film about the way men should be, or want to be, and how they are as represented by the 3 characters. Or is it just cowboy gun-fights. I dunno. Brilliant. Chills up the spine when the mexican band start playing."

1.0,rio_bravo,One of the best westerns.

1.0,rio_bravo,"John Wayne was a great comedic actor, and Dino gives a fantastic performance. The anti-High Noon, it's a relaxed, long, light-hearted character-driven picture. See is just for the duet between Dino and Ricky Nelson."
1.0,rio_bravo,i really like this film.
1.0,rio_bravo,"""I guess we made him talk after all. """
1.0,rio_bravo,"This relaxed, character driven western may be Howard Hawk's most personal film. Much more about friendship and professional camaraderie than action or violence. Classic Hollywood filmmaking at it's best."

1.0,rio_bravo,"Dean Martin or Angie Dickinson? Who do I love more? It's a toss up. Don't even get me started on my main man Ricky Nelson, poor little fool."
1.0,rio_bravo,"Howard Hawks had a brain, and he wasn't afraid to use it. The entire case (almost) gives incredible performances, with Dean Martin and Angie Dickinson almost stealing the show from Wayne. It earns the definition of ""classic""."
1.0,rio_bravo,A true masterpiece. Walter Brenan is great. My favourite western.

1.0,rio_bravo,"Ricky Nelson Was Hottttt. So was, in a way, Dean Martin"

1.0,rio_bravo,Uh who wouldn't love this movie.. Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson singing. That just warms a girl's heart. That and I absolutely love anything John Wayne plays in.
1.0,rio_bravo,A superbly-crafted western built on characters rather than action or landscapes. The Duke's presence leads the film but the rest of the cast are strong enough that he doesn't overshadow them.

1.0,rio_bravo,I REALLY LOVE THIS MOVIE!
1.0,rio_bravo,"A charming, funny, warm western, certainly John Wayne's best and a movie I've loved since childhood. While The Good, the Bad and the Ugly may define the genre as the western epic, this wins the heart."
1.0,rio_bravo,the duke is the foookin daddy
1.0,rio_bravo,The movie that inspired so many film makers. It is perfect. Walter Brennan portrays the best character that ever existed in any film....the one and only stumpy.

1.0,rio_bravo,I've typed many different attempts at writing something for this movie. But nothing does it justice. This film is incredible.
1.0,rio_bravo,"The quintessential cowboy movie, I've seen a lot and they don't get any better than this. Even the 'lamest'(?)part of the movie where Ricky and Deano do a song is damn awesome. Walter Brennan, Johnny Wayne. Say NO MORE!!!"
1.0,rio_bravo,"Seriously everything about this film is perfect. Before, I had heard people call it slow-paced. What a load of bull! The time just floats by. Before, I thought John Ford was the master of the Wester, but after watching this I seriously needed to reconsider."

1.0,rio_bravo,2 or 3 of john wayne!
1.0,rio_bravo,"I have seen Rio Bravo more often than any other film, and it never gets old. Hawks, Wayne and the rest are at the top of their game."
1.0,rio_bravo,"With the steely competence of his adventure films, and the usual upending of the same typical of his comedies, it might be Hawks' richest, most complete film. Certainly Wayne has never been better--and he's easily outdone by Martin and Dickinson."
1.0,rio_bravo,John Wanye and Dean Martin...Think thats says enough! I watched this with my grandad and is the total reason why I love it. [Apart from Wayne and Martin]
1.0,rio_bravo,The best western ever. Period. No discussion.

1.0,jurassic_park,"When you watch this film, you forget that it was made over 20 years ago as the special effects are so superb. It is an adventure suitable for all, as well as providing some classic moments of cinema. Another Spielberg epic. John Williams' score is a masterpiece."

1.0,throne_of_blood,Simply the best adaptation of the classic Shakespeare play.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"10 out of 10:Beautifully filmed, well acted, and exciting, Throne of Blood makes the best adaptation of MacBeth."
1.0,throne_of_blood,One of the best Shakspearean adaptations takes place in feudal Japan. It's impossible to take your eyes off this awe-inspiring masterpiece.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"My second Kurosawa film based on a Shakespearean play. As much as I loved Ran, this i felt was better acted and flowed better as a film."
1.0,throne_of_blood,I shall taint these woods crimsom
1.0,throne_of_blood,A wonderful example of Japanese melodrama.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Not as good as ""Ran"", but Akira Kurosawa is truly the Great Lord of Shakespeare, even as he rests in his grave."
1.0,throne_of_blood,The film was beautiful!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A masterpiece, both as a Shakespeare adaptation and as a moving drama."
1.0,throne_of_blood,MACBETH WITH SAMURAI COULD YOU ASK FOR A MORE AWESOME MOVIE
1.0,throne_of_blood,Arguably the best adaptation of Macbeth ever made.
1.0,throne_of_blood,this is THE in in only Macbeth Film you habe to watch....
1.0,throne_of_blood,a truly masterful retelling of macbeth.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Brilliant in every way
1.0,throne_of_blood,Throne of Blood is my very own introduction to Shakespeare though not the first. The combination of Kurosawa and Mifune is simply unbeatable!
1.0,throne_of_blood,When my literature class of emo-flunkies rates this B&W; 1957 Shakespeare film over Branagh and Gibson...you know something's special about it. Kurosawa was never better and Shakespeare was never dignified as much on screen. Sorry Ken & Larry!
1.0,throne_of_blood,Pretty much perfect.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Haunting in the most visually appealing ways with impressive illusive effects seen in Kurosawa's films. Throne of Blood is very dark and spiritual with a great stage play brought to life. Also, and again, Mifune delivers."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"One of the most fresh, intelligent, visually-effective and purely magnificent takes on the old Shakespeare tale of deceit, greed, and bloodthirsty desires. Mifune and Yamada perform in the most striking and memorable way."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"The first time I saw it, at the end--when a certain forest literally started moving--I thought that Mr. Kurosawa had gone and changed the ending to the bard's play."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa is regarded as one of the great filmmakers of all time, and it's easy to see why. This is a majestic, enthralling film that reinterprets Shakespeare's Macbeth as a bold and truly epic Samurai picture. Hands down a contender for the best adaptation of the Bard ever put to film."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Best Macbeth adaptation ever. Should be a classic on everyone's shelf
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa's samurai retelling of Macbeth is brilliantly evocative and legend has it Mifune seriously risked his life making the ending. Repeated viewings make his villainous character appear more sympathetic.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Mifune again is superb as in Seven Samurai. This time the tradgedy of Macbeth translated into the Japanese medium and it is superbly handled. The ending is incredible and the film haunting from start to finish, Kurosawa's vision is beautiful, haunting and epic."
1.0,throne_of_blood,An amazing adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth. Set in feudal Japan with Kurosawa regular Toshiro Mifune masterly taking the lead role accompanied by by equally stunning screen performance by Isuzu Yamada as his wife. The ending has to be seen to be believed and has not been bettered to this day.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa's version of Macbeth---a feast for the eye--wonderful, a perfect movie, and true to the feeling of the original Shakespeare play"
1.0,throne_of_blood,A magnificent adapttion of the Shakespeare`s play!
1.0,throne_of_blood,It?s a must see! It?s shows how silence sometimes speaks louder than any word!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"The best version of any Shakespearian play on film, despite it being Macbeth transplanted to feudal Japan. Amazing in every respect!"
1.0,throne_of_blood,Amazing adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth. Probably a more Shakespearean film than nearly all the traditional movies of the bard's works. Must see.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Along with Seven Samurai, Kurosawa's best."
1.0,throne_of_blood,My only exposure to Shakespeare is through Kurosawa...
1.0,throne_of_blood,THRONE OF BLOOD (1957)
1.0,throne_of_blood,Perhaps Kurosawa's masterpiece.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Brilliant re-telling of Macbeth and one of Kurasawa'a best.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Toshrio MiFune is wonderful and just brilliant. and wow what an ending. officially in my three endings of all time
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Wonderful, robust classic Japanese retelling of ""Macbeth."" Beautifully filmed and boldly acted, with a chilling musical score. One of the greatest Shakespeare adaptations you will ever see."
0.0,throne_of_blood,I cared about Macbeth as a tragic figure. Washizu can suck arrow.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A Japanese classic, Kurosawa's adaptation of Macbeth."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"One of the very best Shakespeare adaptations. Akira Kurosawa not only retells the story to perfection but he also blends the themes of the original with his own themes and Japanese history, just as well as he did with his much later film Ran."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"The Shakespearean influence is obviously there, not only in story, but the film itself has a very theatre-esque feeling to it. The ending was fantastic. One of Kurosawa's best films."
1.0,throne_of_blood,A fantastic film adaptation of MacBeth's play in which fog and tangled forest webs emphasize the limits on man's foresight.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Macbeth set in feudal Japan, just brilliant. Mifune, as ever and I loved Isuzu Yamada as Lady Macbeth, still and emotionless steadily egging him on to his doom."
1.0,throne_of_blood,A brilliant adaptation on an epic scale.
1.0,throne_of_blood,The best film adaptation of Shakespeare ever. Incredible film.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"If theres a better film adaptation from a shakespear play (maybe Ran, but its a close call) than throne of bllod, I'd love to see it. Throne of blood is creepy, stunning, and masterfully made. Theres alot of depth behind the main characters, and its not just another re-telling of a shakespear play."
1.0,throne_of_blood,A great adaptation by Kurosawa of MacBeth. This movie will stand alone from other Kurosawa films because it is a different kind of story(with the exception of Ran)from the gunslinger fashioned ronin samurai.
1.0,throne_of_blood,A great adaptation of a great Shakespearian play. Stunning cinematography and acting. Very true to the play with only one significant change in the ending. But the change is (dare I say) better than the original. Recommended for anyone who likes Shakespeare.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Brilliant! Kurosawa's version of Macbeth in a samurai style.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Toshiro Mifune, Isuzu Yamada, Takashi Shimura, and Minoru Chiaki star in one of the many highlights of Akira Kurosawa's career."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"This fast, fun action film from legendary director Akira Kurosawa is a fascinating re-telling of Shakespeare's MACBETH, as set in feudal Japan."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Another masterpiece of a film by Akira Kurosawa. A fantastically unique take on Shakespeare's Macbeth starring the powerful force that is Toshiro Mifune.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Izvanredno. Ritam je jos bolji nego u Rashomonu, cini mi se. Uistinu dramatican film. Nema slabe tocke. Sad jos da procitam Macbeth..."
1.0,throne_of_blood,this movie rocked! I forgot how much I love kurasawa movies
1.0,throne_of_blood,so incredibly moody. fantastic performance by mifune.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"It's like watching the Psycho shower scene on repeat! So extreme and horrifying and messy, but so brilliant."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa never did any wrong when it came to making movies, especially with his favorite actor Mifune on his side."
0.0,throne_of_blood,"As much as I normally love Kurasowa, I just couldn't get through this. Maybe someday I'll give it another chance."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Arguably the finest cinematic adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth and one of Kurosawa's best films.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Better than Shakespeare!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa's best ever ! He highlighted perfectly the mystical dimension of Macbeth.Toshiro Mifune is amazing : a warlord returning from the battlefield to his homeland, fighting against his destiny ; against himself and his own craziness...Untill the end, which is totally apocalyptical."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"You put Toshiro Mifune, Akira Kurosawa, and a Shakespeare story together in a room and it's going to take a lot for it not to be fantastic."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Can Macbeth get any better than this? Loved the scene with the moving forest. Wow.
1.0,throne_of_blood,I love this film!!! There has never been a greater actor than Mifune Toshiro. Shakespeare should be proud.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A bona-fide Kurosawa masterpiece. Epic in its scope, its themes, its origins in Shakespeare and Noh theatre, and its lead performance by the walking supernova himself, Toshiro Mifune."
1.0,throne_of_blood,A brilliant adaptation of Macbeth set in feudal Japan. Incredibly directed by Akira Kurosawa. Absolutely stunning...which is to be expected from Kurosawa.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Probably the best adaptation of Macbeth put on screen. Kurosawa at his greatest and with powerhouse performances. The forest scene is absolutely unforgettable: the Bard would be ecstatic.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Simply sublime Cinema
1.0,throne_of_blood,By far the best version of Macbeth that I have seen. Toshiro Mifune is amazing in this role.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"to be(st ran) or not to be(st throne of blood), this is the question !!!!"
1.0,throne_of_blood,Great Kurosawa movie based on Macbeth. The final death scene was amazing and the special effects of the spirits are really cool too. The acting of Toshiro Mifune is always great. The costumes are pretty amazing too.
1.0,throne_of_blood,questions:you can act with just movement? the directors job is to anticipate human emotion? noh theatre: far is close?
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa turned Shakespeare's Macbeth into an amazing film!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A+. A version of Shakespeare's Macbeth, just in the samurai era."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Possibly the best film adaptation of Shakespeare ever. Definitely the best free interpretation, and the most cinematic."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa's compelling ""samurai"" adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth. This isn't just a typical retelling of the story or a film version of the stage play, this is much more of a character study with surprising depth and motivation. An epic film, in every sense of the word."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa's adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth. Stunning for it's time with a surreal feel to it and a story full of metaphors. A masterpiece.17 January 2009
1.0,throne_of_blood,"That evil spirit in the forest could have suggested Washizu get a divorce, but noooooo"
1.0,throne_of_blood,This is actually the first film by Akira Kurosawa that I have ever saw in my life. Kurosawa brilliantly combines the same human elements of Shakesphere's tragedy MacBeth with Japanese history.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A very moving and intense treatment of Shakespeare's Macbeth. Kurasawa was a master at translating Shakespeare into Japanese culture. Mifune is terrific. Very stylistic, though, and not for everyone."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Best Shakespeare adaptation ever (followed closely by 'Ran'). Mifune's final scenes in the film are cenima at its very finest
1.0,throne_of_blood,Easily the greatest screen adaptation of Macbeth (despite the plot adjustments)
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Not so much a tragedy as it is an unrelenting nightmare. I've always found Toshiro Mifune's acting to be somewhat exaggerated, but here his ferocious paranoia is perfectly suited to the role."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"My personal favorite among Kurosawa's film. Haunting, surreal and nightmarish, this is Kurosawa's darkest film yet. Mifune's best performance in my opinion."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"great atmosphere, love the human pincushion ending"
1.0,throne_of_blood,"If not for ""Seven Samurai"" this would be Kurosawas best film period."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa coordinates the best adaptation of Macbeth on-screen and Mifune is orgiastic in the lead role.What more can you ask when you're watching two legends dancing to the cinematic rhythm?
1.0,throne_of_blood,It's Kurosawa - It's Shakespeare. What else is there left to say!
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa. Mifune. Shakespeare. I don't know what else you want from here. Another one of my undisputed favorites.I wanna be buried with this movie.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Adaptacion cinematografica de ""Macbeth"" (Shakespeare), probablemente la mejor que se haya hecho. El teatro Kabuki y Noh construyen las actuaciones, y la ultima escena es una de las cosas mas impresionantes que un ser humano puede ver."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Greatest film adaptation of MacBeth. Dark and haunting. The visuals will stick with you for a long time.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Macbeth, Kurosawa style. Fantastic."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Akira Kurosawa's outstanding treatment of Shakespeare's MacBeth set in medieval Japan.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa takes Macbeth by the horns and makes it his servant. The master never disappointed.
1.0,throne_of_blood,It's MacBeth with Samurais. It fooking perfect.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Haunting images and wrenching story make this a standout Kurosawa.
1.0,throne_of_blood,this is always worth another viewing!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Need I explain myself? This movie ""Kumonosu jo as it is called in Japanese is Akira Kurosawa's Magbeth! There can be no parellel to kurosawa in film history, and yes, this movie casts Toshiro Mifune."
1.0,throne_of_blood,The best Shakespeare adaptation I've ever seen. Kurosawa at his best without a doubt. The way that Kurosawa compensates for the language problems with the superb and subtle actions is genius.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurasawa directs Mifune in Japanese adaptation of the ""Scottish Play."""
1.0,throne_of_blood,Greatest finale ever? Maybe Mifune's finest performance.
1.0,throne_of_blood,A completely wonderful Shakespearian adaptation. One of Kurosawa's best. Toshiro Minfune is just amazing...as usual.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Throne of Blood is one of the few truly great movies that makes me excited for the possibilities of film rather than depressed at the failures.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"YES! YES! YES! Kurosawa's samurai version of Macbeth is beyond brilliant: creepy, surreal, beautiful, and riveting."

1.0,throne_of_blood,The best verison of Macbeth out there.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa's take on Macbeth. Gruesome, violent and superbly acted. This is one you will not forget. The Lady Macbeth character in this movie is a wonderful precursor to the one in RAN."

1.0,throne_of_blood,One of Kurosawa's best. Possibly the most visceral screen adaptation of shakespeare yet.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"This is Kurosawa's ""Macbeth"" . The language of Shakespeare is missing but the power, evil and terror are there. The ending is jaw-dropping. A reporter asked Mifune how he managed to look so terrified during the final scene. ""Because I WAS terrified,"" he answered."
1.0,throne_of_blood,I have seen many versions of Macbeth. Kurosawa did a wonderful job retelling the story in this samauri tale. Wow! Kurosawa never fails..

1.0,throne_of_blood,Yes. My favorite movie all time.
1.0,throne_of_blood,The visuals alone are worth the watching....
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Oddly, this is a scary-ass interpretation of Macbeth...Isuzu Yamada might be the scariest person in history."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"another unlikely yet fully successful mix. kurosawa's vision of macbeth is, as always, breathtaking."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Hommes trop faibles, femmes trop fortes... le pouvoir n'est jamais dans les mains de celui qu'on croit (Cf RAN pour confirmer cette histoire)."

1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa's Macbeth. Haunting and spectacular.
1.0,throne_of_blood,an obscenely subtle movie - shakespeare in a kabuki mask. one of my fav kurosawa films
1.0,throne_of_blood,Another Shakespeare insipred Kurosawa film.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"One of my favorite Kurosawa films, and one of my favorite Shakespeare adaptations. Maniacal Noh-inspired performances, ultra spooky sets and lighting, and a finale to make one quiver all over, so to speak..."
1.0,throne_of_blood,It's Macbeth in Japan. Phenomenal story and characters. If you know Shakespeare then this film is really fun to watch to see how everything is translated through
1.0,throne_of_blood,Shakespeare in Asia.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Just great shots and superb acting. Best adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth and one of the greatest Movies ever.

1.0,throne_of_blood,My second favorite cinematic adaptation of Shakespeare (right behind Strange Brew).
1.0,throne_of_blood,"This movie is so creepy and good--it's like Shakespeare should have been Japanese. I mean, it's amazing. Superb attention to detail; lots of authentic samurai garb and traditional Japanese music."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Yes it is Macbeth, and yes it is done right. You can really see Kurosawa's experiences as a painter show through in the chase scene with the witch."
1.0,throne_of_blood,awesome play of shadows!!!!!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa doesn't need one more person blowing smoke up his ass, but this is by far one of my favorite adaptations of Shakespeare. If you haven't seen it then you should, if you don't want to see it you're an asshole and should kill yourself."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"The final image of Kurosawa's Macbeth character, played by Toshiro Mifune, captures all that is tragic in the warrior-king. Another of Kurosawa's brilliant war films, Throne of Blood is the best reimagining of Shakespeare to come along until Ran, nearly thirty years later."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa's best film, in my opinion. One of his bloodiest, if not the bloodiest. I saw ""Macbeth"" on stage in London earlier this year and I think ""throne of Blood"" is the definitive retelling of that play. This film is breathtaking!"
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A great chance to see a master filmmaker and a world-class actor change everything you thought you knew about ... well, something that resembles Shakespeare."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Akira Kurosawa directs this amazing retelling of Macbeth. Toshiro Mifune (Washizu) is totally believable as the betrayer, while Isuzu Yamada (as Washizu's wife) is haunting as the distraught wife.There is no better production of Macbeth in any form than this movie."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Without a doubt my favorite Kurosawa film. Has everything that makes him great.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Shot beautifully, the contrasts are unreal, the portrayal of Yama-uba is horrifying. Truly great film."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa likes to create his own tales from others before him, and others do the same with Kurosawa's work, this time, he tackles Shakespeare and Macbeth. This is a fine masterpiece, its a great visual take and a deep powerful take rooted in the annuals of time."
1.0,throne_of_blood,the awesome toshiro mifune turned into a sieve in an amazing ending. great shakespeare!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Welles's was like a bad speed trip- - -sweaty, agit. Polanski gutted it, spilt blood. But Kurosawa, he spooked Macbeth up. Into hallucination, into ghost story, into fever dream. So he wins."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Its a really good and creepy interpretation of Macbeth. Its spooky!!!!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Stunning realisation - the fortress and battles, are stunning, in a typical Kurosawa stylee."

1.0,throne_of_blood,Maybe my favorite Kurosawa film.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa tackles Shakespeare's MacBeth. A precursor to his masterpiece Ran is almost as visceral and intriguing. This is the coldest film I have seen by Kurosawa with one of the most powerful and well executed endings of his whole library.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Oustanding photography and filming
1.0,throne_of_blood,In my opinion this is one of the only two truly great film adaptations of Macbeth.

1.0,throne_of_blood,Great Japanese adaption of MacBeth. This is easily one of Toshiro Mifune's greatest works.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"amazing imagery. Toshiro Mufune finest moment. The ""Lady Macbeth"" character in her kimono slithering about like a snake was also amazing."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"One of the most perfect Macbeths I have ever seen - despite not having a scrap of Shakespeare in the script. Ferociously powerful, hauntingly believable brilliance."
1.0,throne_of_blood,A magnificent adaptation of that Scottish play (Macbeth)! One of Kurosawa's best!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A take on Shakespeare's Macbeth that captures the violent power of the story. It lacks the poetry of Shakespeare's verse, but the surreal imagery is a fine compensation. The scene in the Cobweb forest with the weird ""sister"" is so creepy. lovelovelove"
1.0,throne_of_blood,Japanese samurai version of MacBeth. Somewhat experimental and very classic.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa's best film, and the best Macbeth adaptation ever made."
1.0,throne_of_blood,?lskar samurajaction. ?lskar Akira Kurosawa!
1.0,throne_of_blood,and i usually find shakespeare boring
1.0,throne_of_blood,Brilliant. A testament to the truth that Shakespeare's works reach their greatest heights when adapted rather than revered.
1.0,throne_of_blood,All i can say is WOW.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A brilliant adaption of macbeth, probably the best, even though it takes place in a japanese setting. Kurosawa tells the story in a dark and gritty manner, that it's thrilling and scary!"
1.0,throne_of_blood,Too bad it's not in color!!!
1.0,throne_of_blood,An amazing telling of the Macbeth story. I completely recommend this not just for the samurai movie fans but for the Shakespear fans as well.

1.0,throne_of_blood,Competes for top position of a Shakespeare adaptation on film

1.0,throne_of_blood,Lady Macbeth at her most devious
1.0,throne_of_blood,"One of his real classics... the highlight is the way each frame is designed to communicate and awake all your senses... its composition, music and the costumes.."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa brings his unerring eye for indelible images to Shakespeare in this 1957 adaptation of Macbeth. By changing the locale from Birnam Wood to 16th-century Japan, Kurosawa makes an oddball argument for the trans-historicity of Shakespeare's narrative. Amazing acting and soundtrack."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa's best movie IMO
1.0,throne_of_blood,"In my opinion, this film shows mifune at his finest. My favourite ever Shakespeare adaptation, only just beating Ran."

1.0,throne_of_blood,"One of Kurosawa's best. Also, it is one of Toshiro Mifune's best performances. God knows you can't beat the ending."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"The greatest screen version of Shakespeare I've ever seen (and I've seen too many...). Kurosawa's distillation of Macbeth captures the tautness and muscularity of Shakespeare's play brilliantly, and Mifune's performance is quite possibly his best."
1.0,throne_of_blood,The master himself amking one of the best Shakespeare adaptation to screen ever...I mean wow!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was a time of light, it was a time of darkness, Kurosawa exploring the duality of a mind and the versatility of life."

1.0,throne_of_blood,I think this may be Kurosawa's best Shakespeare adaptation.

1.0,throne_of_blood,"Now, that's a Lady M!"
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa retells Macbeth. Mifune brings it to life and risks his life (for real) to tell this tale. One of many movies that I believe everyone should see.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Shakespeare's Macbeth set in fuedal Japan, with suitable twists and cultural modifications to make this a genuine story all its own. The ending is superb. Now if only the real Macbeth were this interesting!"
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Visually its amazing, Mifune's acting is stark and so confident. This movie along with ""I Live in Fear"" just cements Mifune as my favourite actor. Its hard to pick a favourite Kurosawa film but this one keeps coming out on top. Its definitely his creepiest."

1.0,throne_of_blood,Macbeth by Kurosawa. A superb film with great acting
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A masterpiece of cinema, from the master Kurosawa. One of the greatest endings ever filmed."

1.0,throne_of_blood,amazing adaptation of macbeth in black and white samurai times. spoiler - they shot real arrows at him at the end!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa's take on Macbeth is nothing short of brilliant. Toshiro Mifune's lead performance is gripping and amazing, as always, and the action and cinematography are first-rate."

1.0,throne_of_blood,"The best Shakespeare adaptation ever, and soooo much better than The Seven Samurai."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa directs this best Shakespeare adaptation ever.Mifune stars as a man driven mad with power etc.The scene when the Trees come to life is still frighteningly real and effective. I have no idea how they pulled off an effect like that back in '57.
1.0,throne_of_blood,almost as brilliant as Kurosawa's more celebrated 'Rashomon'. it's almost impossible to fault this brilliant adaptation of Shakespeare's 'Macbeth'.

1.0,logan_2017,"Changes the way we look at the X-Men, it may be depressing but that's just like real life so suck it up other reviewers!"

1.0,logan_2017,"To put it bluntly, ""This ain't your daddy's X-Men."" Logan is a violent, bloody, and gory film about Hugh Jackman's final bow as one of the most enduring characters in Comic Book films. A definite must see not just for fans of X-Men/Wolverine, but anyone who is a film-noir buff."
1.0,logan_2017,"A fantastic comic book movie that is also a fantastic movie, this film shows the dark side of characters we have loved for years yet we can't help but care for them in this dark and wonderfully told tale. A riveting work of cinema."
1.0,logan_2017,"Logan's final stand is a compelling, grim and dark tale with a grounded story and lovable characters. You can't help but feel Logan and company's agony and hardship as they go through many challenges to live a better life."
1.0,logan_2017,"Perfect send-off for Hugh Jackman's 17 year run as The Wolverine. It's gritty, emotional, and extremely satisfying. Loved every minute of it."
1.0,logan_2017,"""Logan"" is one of the year's best. ""Logan"" is now my favorite hero movie. James Mangold creates the elegy of the hero in mortality and ultimately love. Hugh Jackman is powerful and nuanced-- his best performance. Dafne Keen is awesome-- she is the new star."
0.0,logan_2017,"Boring.Lots of violence, but without inspiring, in the viewer, a desire for justice/vengence or of fear for the protagonists.The characters are unlikeable.. The plot uninspired and predictable."

0.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,"A psychedelic waste pit of ugly UA animation, a song the only makes sense if you are on LSD, an bad acting."
1.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,"It's visuals may not be of the comprehension of some viewers (inluding me) but that can't remove the fact that Yellow Submarine is more than a musical, it's an authentic piece of art. Even many years after it's release, it has the same magic."
1.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,Endlessly inventive animation invigorates this tale of the Beatles saving a psychadelic fantasy land from a nasty horde of invaders. The images stagger the imagination and overall the film serves as the perfect complement to the Fab Four's late 60's material.
1.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,My favorite movie ever!
1.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,"""Yellow Submarine (1968)"" is one of the most imaginative and psychedelic animation films of all time, especially when you count the music of The Beatles."

1.0,1005973-diva,Brilliant little film.
1.0,1005973-diva,"The most accessably enjoyable serious art film I've ever seen. Very surprised this is so widely forgotten. Saw it in the theatre when it was new, and it has definitely held up over the years."
1.0,1005973-diva,"A movie that manages to capture a spine tingling stillness and beauty through its distinctive chromatic palette, it's magical backdrop, and it's slightly staged acting.An indulgent, meloncholc masterpiece. A film for a rainy winter's afternoon."
1.0,1005973-diva,"Beautiful...Spectacular... A Masterpiece. A post punk french film which, in my opinion, closes out the French 'new wave' of cinema."
1.0,1005973-diva,Wonderfully filmed and acted with an interestingly diverse cast.
1.0,1005973-diva,Andy Warhol inspired set and Cheesy 80's graphics... CLASSIC!
1.0,1005973-diva,One of the greatest movies ever made.
1.0,1005973-diva,Highly stylish and complex thriller is a film lover's delight!

1.0,1005973-diva,"An all time favorite. Interesting plot. Atmospheric. Cool. Operatic. No, literally. Plus Citroens."
1.0,1005973-diva,Coolest French film I've ever seen. Complex story line and mesmerizing photography. Just brilliant. A
1.0,1005973-diva,"My first French, great way to put visual, story and music together, it was a movie shockly opened my eye! ( I just fund out that I can serch movies not only from US.)"
1.0,1005973-diva,Romance is not dead as long as this film lives.
1.0,1005973-diva,One of the most beautifully filmed movies of all time with an incredible sound track
1.0,1005973-diva,"I saw this film when it first came out in the cinemas, have seen it since on DVd, and even now the trailer still gives me goosebumps (but does not do the movie justice). In parts it's a satire of the French ""new wave"" cinema. See the whole movie! It's fun, quirky, & romantic."
1.0,1005973-diva,"just absolutely love this film, use of colour, music,everything"
1.0,1005973-diva,Made me wish I had a warehouse as a house :)
1.0,1005973-diva,"Watched Diva again - it never fails to impress, great music, great script, great cinematography...what more could you ask for? Watch it if you haven't seen it!"
1.0,1005973-diva,"Action-packed, kooky, thrilling, funny. Strange in a very entertaining way."
1.0,1005973-diva,"Mopeds, gangsters and opera with wit and humility; what more can you ask of a film?"
1.0,1005973-diva,The score. The chic. '60s French New Wave updated to '80s New Wave.
1.0,1005973-diva,"Even if the film had nothing else to offer, Wilhelmenia Wiggins Fernandez's haunting soprano arias give this film an irresistible, other-worldly feel. A dream-like, off-kilter film about obsession, kept on track with its subtle, off-beat humor."
1.0,1005973-diva,"One of my all time favorite movies. Every frame is gorgeous, the story is engaging and suspenseful. Characters that are truly unique."
1.0,1005973-diva,This was the movie Red picked. It is almost 17 years to the day from the moment we watched our favorite picks together.
1.0,1005973-diva,My favourite all time move (and also turned me on to opera). Just don't take it too seriously ... fantastic scene where Jules plays Alba his bootleg recording of 'La Wally' by Cynthia Hawkins.
1.0,1005973-diva,Best movie ever ... when I was 17
1.0,1005973-diva,"fantastic,but dont watch the dubbed version.This film has so much style and story,the moped chase is outstanding and locations are excellent.Make sure you have the subtitles on it adds to the films aura. The operatic talents of Wilhelmenia Fernandez are amazing and captivating."
1.0,1005973-diva,Man oh Man is this film amazing. The night cinematography is amazing and the simpleness of sound.
1.0,1005973-diva,I just love this film!
1.0,1005973-diva,Do not accept overdubbing - only with subtitles
1.0,1005973-diva,"Bit of weirdy French effort, but gripping all the way through."
1.0,1005973-diva,My favorite film in high school and college. Stylish and strange and creative. I've probably seen this movie over thirty times now. Qui a vole la robe de la diva?
1.0,1005973-diva,Just caught the rerelease at The Charles. First time on big screen for me. The music still brings shivers.
1.0,1005973-diva,colors in this film are perfect!
1.0,1005973-diva,"this is a poetic thriller, brilliant!"
1.0,1005973-diva,"Amazing! great suspense, amazing soundtrack, very funny quirky characters, BRILLIANT direction and editing."
0.0,1005973-diva,"Sheer crapfest! Definitely high in the top ten of the worst movies, I've ever seen. Soooo boring, and - worst of all - stylistically self-indulgent in a very annoying way. Avoid!"
1.0,1005973-diva,"Mystery, punk music, opera (the amazing Willemina), streets of Paris, the Zen of a loaf of broad.... c'est fantastique! I still LOVE and PLAY the soundtrack at least a few times a year!"
1.0,1005973-diva,the first time I saw a minimal loft apartment was on this film - seared into my visual-spatial memory it formed part of me
1.0,1005973-diva,80's french new wave....love it!
1.0,1005973-diva,"Classic crazy 80's movie that confounds and confuses, but is awesome in its brilliance. Even if opera is not your thing, Wilhelmenia Wiggins Fernandez's performances are astounding. Great movie...will always love it."
1.0,1005973-diva,"80's French new wave crazy awesomeness. Saw it in the theatre with my parents, loved it, and it still holds up."
1.0,1005973-diva,"When Diva came out, it was like a UFO in the old country! Stylish, smart, daring story -- It's a milestone in the French cinema landscape. Beineix at his best."
1.0,1005973-diva,If you liked this check out La Balance (1982).
1.0,1005973-diva,"Wacky plot, cool French people, romance and beautiful music and imagery--what more could one want in a movie?"
1.0,1005973-diva,"If a single movie can make you fall in love with French cinema, this has to be it. A masterpiece."
1.0,1005973-diva,Really stylish when it first came out. I still enjoy watching this film.
1.0,1005973-diva,this is the best film ever - I don't have the patience to watch one normally - but this just blows you away

1.0,1005973-diva,"One of the most atmospheric films, with a wonderful story, ever made."
1.0,1005973-diva,"This movie is just BEAUTIFUL!!! The story, the cast, the opera...simply divine!"
1.0,1005973-diva,one of my top 5 films
1.0,1005973-diva,Every shot is candy to the eye.

1.0,1005973-diva,"What makes French thrillers so stylish? I've enjoyed Hidden and Tell no-one this year, but Diva is the one to fall in love wiht."
1.0,1005973-diva,SO glad this is now out on DVD. I keenly remember seeing it my freshman year of college and just being blown away. An essential New Wave '80s movie.
1.0,1005973-diva,you either get it or youre a caveman/woman
1.0,1005973-diva,"cult..watched it 6 times,great photography..."
1.0,1005973-diva,"french style ''subtle intuitive cerebral james bond, but better'' & of course the SOUNDTRACK !!"
1.0,1005973-diva,This movie is one of the most beautiful movies I have seen in a while. It stays with you long after the final image has faded from the screen.
1.0,1005973-diva,This film is the shit
1.0,1005973-diva,My very first foreign film and it was fantastic. And I've been hooked on foreign films ever since.
1.0,1005973-diva,"Visually, the top movie of all time."
1.0,1005973-diva,un des films cultes des ann¨¦es 80'
1.0,1005973-diva,The coolest movie ever.
1.0,1005973-diva,"Yeah, it's embarrassing that it's been one of my favorites since I was 14. Then again, it's freaking fantastic. Noir galore. Enjoy it. Will make you want love, and to see an opera."
1.0,1005973-diva,another great movie by Luc Bresson
0.0,1005973-diva,This film's glamorization of pedophilia and celebrity stalking seems more and more offensive with each passing year.
1.0,1005973-diva,"i have to say it, it's very french. beautiful scenes and color (i love all of the lighting, and jules' warehouse space is very cool), wilhelmenia fernandez's incredible voice, and great attention to detail add to the twisted plot."
1.0,1005973-diva,Gorgeous and gripping. 'nuff said.
1.0,1005973-diva,Great movie! Love the lofts.
1.0,1005973-diva,got to the film forum asap! cool and funny
1.0,1005973-diva,"Perhaps the most picturesque film to come out of France in years, unified by the extraordinary decor - colour supplement chic meets pop art surrealism - which creates a world of totally fantastic reality situated four-square in contemporary Paris."
1.0,1005973-diva,"So... French. Beautiful, scary, fluffy."
1.0,1005973-diva,best movie i have seen up to date
1.0,1005973-diva,"My fave of all time - and I'm not sure why. All I know is that I can watch this movie again and again, and never get tired of it."
1.0,1005973-diva,"A modern masterpiece- hip, punk, chic, elegant, complex, dreamlike, quirky, surprising."
1.0,1005973-diva,A classic!! I've seen it at least 30 times.Beautiful pictures - twisted story!
1.0,1005973-diva,"It's a great film ... it's got opera, murder, and love! What's not to love?!"
1.0,1005973-diva,"my favorite movie ever. it's got it all, love, action, mystery, drama and the most hauntingly beautiful soundtrack ever."
1.0,1005973-diva,"Totally absorbing, and always surprising. Beautiful singing, and some of the best visual gags on film. Ever."
1.0,1005973-diva,great film for it's time and still as good today.
1.0,1005973-diva,"Rolig, sp?¡ènnande, vacker och underlig... ja, den h?¡èr filmen har det mesta."
1.0,1005973-diva,"One of the first films that took me out of my seat and into the screen..ambient, beautiful, emotive, disconnected and stylish"
1.0,1005973-diva,"A fun, cool French movie with a postman, gangsters, and an opera diva."
1.0,1005973-diva,An action film directed with space in it. One of the most memorable scenes is buttering a baguette. You won't see that in a Steven Seagal movie.
1.0,1005973-diva,The story is as relevant today as then; and the cinematography is amazing.
1.0,1005973-diva,"A crazy French thriller, a prime example of la cinema du look. Classic Vespa chase. ONLY a French action movie would have a Vespa chase."
1.0,1005973-diva,"I love this movie more than any other. Watch it whenever I'm feeling bad about life. Unbelievably beautiful, fun and smart."
1.0,1005973-diva,"A brilliant French thriller cleverly deals with copyright issues, as the performance of an opera diva is taped without approval. Suddenly everybody's after the bootleg tape. Watch out, Jules!"
1.0,1005973-diva,"just cool, and super music"
1.0,1005973-diva,Would love to see it again. I just remember it being visually magnificent and VERY funny.
1.0,1005973-diva,when I saw it the first time it was the coolest and best film ever. Having seen it acouple if times more recently it becomes clear how much before its time it was
1.0,1005973-diva,"Fabulous, loads of plot twists, cool Zen man and the best car in the world!"
1.0,1005973-diva,this is about respect & love of music
1.0,1005973-diva,Ice-cool and absorbing mystery wrapped around 2 tapes and as many love stories...
1.0,1005973-diva,"One of my all-time faves for its great music and ""french-ness"". A classic."
1.0,1005973-diva,The coolest film for a style conscious cat
1.0,1005973-diva,"Still awesome after all these years - the music, the plot and the gorgeous cinematography make this a real treat."
1.0,1005973-diva,"COOL Just COOL -- This is the best of the free-wheeling optimistic, liberal, open-minded 80's France. The last good big-bucks French movie ever made (sighs...)"
1.0,1005973-diva,25 years later it is still fantastic to see again.
1.0,1005973-diva,"Visually stunning, hyperkinetic thriller has it all. It's a shame that Wilhelmina Wiggins-Fernandez (the diva herself) cannot act -- but she has such a transcendent voice that it hardly matters. Every other aspect is perfect."
1.0,1005973-diva,Lovely film with odd characters + a very nice sound track.
1.0,1005973-diva,BRILLIANT movie - one of my all time greats
1.0,1005973-diva,Beineix! Not your typical French film. A bit of brooding but mostly great fun...
1.0,1005973-diva,"Beautiful, intelligent, surprising, funny, subtle - just make sure you are watching the original or a well synchronized version. Sub-titles spoil it all."
1.0,1005973-diva,"A 1980s movie that is pure art. Amazing soundtrack, beautiful scenery, quirky characters, artfully shot. What it lacks in substance (and in the acting talents of operatic talent Ms. Fernandez), it more than makes up for in style and thrills. One of my all-time favorites."
1.0,1005973-diva,Den kj?lige elegansen kombinert med vakker opera og filming slo meg i bakken
1.0,1005973-diva,"This film is saturated with Wilhelmenia Wiggins Fernandez's divine operatic vocals. The cast of French oddities have never been bettered, with a roller skating teenage thief, a postal worker who loves opera but steals the diva's dress and a hippy recluse who is trying to make the perfect baguette."
1.0,1005973-diva,A stylish visual and musical feast.
1.0,1005973-diva,"the film that got me into scooters, opera, and baghettes with caviar.. have never looked back"
1.0,1005973-diva,They don't come any better than this
1.0,1005973-diva,Watch as a double bill with Subway. This is a teenage 'i'm so alternative' staple. Helped make me feel special...
1.0,1005973-diva,Un autre de mes films fetiches
1.0,1005973-diva,It built up its reputation in over a year of cinema release before it became a massive hit. That just would not be possible now.
1.0,1005973-diva,This movie is so beautifully made and the story is so engaging and DIFFERENT even though the theme is universal. I also love the soundtrack.
1.0,1005973-diva,je n'aime pas Beethoven
1.0,1005973-diva,This was one of my favourite films. I have watched it a ridiculous number of times. Had the soundtrack as well. Saw Wilhelmena Fernandez live in concert. She was as good in person as in the film. Read the book and others that this was based on.
1.0,1005973-diva,Serioulsy cool film. The theme song is out of this world.
1.0,1005973-diva,Beineix's first film - simply stunning - could watch it again and again. PS the trick of wearing a mask and snorkel to chop onions does not work!
1.0,1005973-diva,"A wonderful, stylish ride"
1.0,1005973-diva,classic 80s French film
1.0,1005973-diva,25 years and still my favorite movie of all time.....paris.....sigh
1.0,1005973-diva,This was a very compelling thriller and I loved every minute of it. I loved the subplots and the intrincate makeup of the whole story. The motorcycle chase and the opera singing was extraordinary. I am not a fan of opera but she made you want to listen to opera! What a voice!
1.0,1005973-diva,My favourite Paris film ever - Paris in the 80s without being cleaned up by Jeunet. Music by way of Opera and cigarettes by way of Gitanes. Beautiful
1.0,1005973-diva,"One of the most beautiful pieces of celluloid ever! Grace Bumbry the femme fatale who is the object of desire for a crazed fan, who decides to take matters into his own hands."
1.0,1005973-diva,"Existentialist thriller, what's not to like?"
1.0,1005973-diva,I love the music... the movie is sick
1.0,1005973-diva,"An amazing French thriller from the early 80s. Great acting, suspense, and action sequences."
1.0,1005973-diva,Cinema du look at its best.
1.0,1005973-diva,"One of my top 10 movies. It is beautiful, quirky, flawed, and ultimately, brilliant."
1.0,1005973-diva,"Murder, conspiracy, opera, mopeds ... and everyone lives in really cool apartments. If I ever manage to visit France in my lifetime, it's going to be such a letdown."
1.0,1005973-diva,One of my all time favorites! Brilliant! Multi-level agenda. Intelligent!
1.0,1005973-diva,"Although it will likely not age well, this is one of my favourites. A new-wave tale of mistaken identity."
1.0,1005973-diva,"Darling French boys, girls on rollerskates, and, yes, the Zen Master... truly one of the best movies ever made."
1.0,1005973-diva,Love French New Wave!
1.0,1005973-diva,"One of the most creative story lines ever, and as abstract as France can get."
1.0,1005973-diva,"If you like weird European movies with great music, you'll love this one."
1.0,1005973-diva,I saw this originally in french class in high school. I thought it was the coolest movie I've ever seen. It was.
1.0,1005973-diva,The protagonist Jules is who I wanted to be in high school. La Wally is the most beautiful piece of music still.
1.0,1005973-diva,Classic. Period. Wilhemenia Higgins Hernandez rocks.
1.0,1005973-diva,"10/10Riveting thriller with style to spare and layers like a . . . multi-layerd cake . . . yeah, cake . . . mmmmm."
