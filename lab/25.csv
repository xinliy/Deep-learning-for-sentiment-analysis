1.0,rio_bravo,"Good versus evil, feelgood movie."

1.0,rio_bravo,"If you only see one Western ever, you might want to make it this one. The actors are all superb and the story, while simple, is compelling. In so many ways this is the model for so many Westerns that came after it (together with films like High Noon)."
1.0,rio_bravo,The best Western from the classic times by far! My favorite John Wayne western of all time.

1.0,rio_bravo,classic hawks john wayne vehicle
1.0,rio_bravo,This is one of my favorite westerns. Not only John Wayne and Dean Martin star in it but so dose Angie Dickinson. Its very similar to El Dardo thoe. But I gusse it was just so amazing the first time the had to make it agine.
1.0,rio_bravo,the cowboy flick to end all cowboy flicks.dean martin is drunk. john wayne is a stand up guy. ricky nelson sings. chyea.
0.0,rio_bravo,"John Wayne should've realized that when you make a film in response to another movie that the movie you're making has to be better than the film you're responding to. Horribly acted, horribly directed, horribly written. 1 star! High Noon is a masterpiece!!!"
1.0,rio_bravo,love this movie it is my husband fav movie it also grew on me
1.0,rio_bravo,"Rio Bravo is probably one of the best Westerns ever made. Wayne is so cool,but its Dean Martin as the drunk who shines for me."
1.0,rio_bravo,i love this movie with guys like John Wayne and Ricky Nelson i also like Dean Martin in this one he plays a good drunk but thats not the only reason i like this movie.Its a really good movie with a great cast in it.
1.0,rio_bravo,"What a cast, a great story and the songs are memorable...one of my top 10"
1.0,rio_bravo,"The most watchable Western of all time. A great buddy movie, a great shoot-em up, a great character study. Howard Hawks puts together the greatest Western/action team of all time with Wayne, Martin, Nelson, Dickinson, and Brennan."
1.0,rio_bravo,John Wayne underplays his character and lets Dean Martin take over in an often overlooked roll. The cast of characters are steadfast western favorites with just enough levity and seriousness to make this a fantastic move beginning to end.
1.0,rio_bravo,the duke kickin but and letting some woman tell him what he feel's

1.0,rio_bravo,"Angie Dickenson was the only negative in this movie. She was stiff and uninteresting, then again, maybe I was jealous??? Also, I was watching this movie at the very moment Ricky Nelson's plane was crashing, resulting in his death. :-("
1.0,rio_bravo,Cowboys + shootouts + singing + Classic western characters in non-classic situations = Howard Hawks' best movie
1.0,rio_bravo,This is a very good movie

1.0,rio_bravo,Every potential US immigrant should be forced to watch this western and then quizzed afterward
1.0,rio_bravo,"This is John Wayne's finest movie that has the Duk,e in his best role: a sheriff. The story is greatly told and fits the age rather well. Not many other Western films come close to this one's calm but dangerous nature"
1.0,rio_bravo,"A great story, especially when you realize it really is Dude's story, one of redemption...also great script. The new DVD, plus extras is excellant. Inspiration for the original Assault on Precint 13...by Carpenter."

1.0,rio_bravo,Y 'a rien de mieux au monde. Promis.
1.0,rio_bravo,"It's actually a romantic film about the way men should be, or want to be, and how they are as represented by the 3 characters. Or is it just cowboy gun-fights. I dunno. Brilliant. Chills up the spine when the mexican band start playing."

1.0,rio_bravo,One of the best westerns.

1.0,rio_bravo,"John Wayne was a great comedic actor, and Dino gives a fantastic performance. The anti-High Noon, it's a relaxed, long, light-hearted character-driven picture. See is just for the duet between Dino and Ricky Nelson."
1.0,rio_bravo,i really like this film.
1.0,rio_bravo,"""I guess we made him talk after all. """
1.0,rio_bravo,"This relaxed, character driven western may be Howard Hawk's most personal film. Much more about friendship and professional camaraderie than action or violence. Classic Hollywood filmmaking at it's best."

1.0,rio_bravo,"Dean Martin or Angie Dickinson? Who do I love more? It's a toss up. Don't even get me started on my main man Ricky Nelson, poor little fool."
1.0,rio_bravo,"Howard Hawks had a brain, and he wasn't afraid to use it. The entire case (almost) gives incredible performances, with Dean Martin and Angie Dickinson almost stealing the show from Wayne. It earns the definition of ""classic""."
1.0,rio_bravo,A true masterpiece. Walter Brenan is great. My favourite western.

1.0,rio_bravo,"Ricky Nelson Was Hottttt. So was, in a way, Dean Martin"

1.0,rio_bravo,Uh who wouldn't love this movie.. Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson singing. That just warms a girl's heart. That and I absolutely love anything John Wayne plays in.
1.0,rio_bravo,A superbly-crafted western built on characters rather than action or landscapes. The Duke's presence leads the film but the rest of the cast are strong enough that he doesn't overshadow them.

1.0,rio_bravo,I REALLY LOVE THIS MOVIE!
1.0,rio_bravo,"A charming, funny, warm western, certainly John Wayne's best and a movie I've loved since childhood. While The Good, the Bad and the Ugly may define the genre as the western epic, this wins the heart."
1.0,rio_bravo,the duke is the foookin daddy
1.0,rio_bravo,The movie that inspired so many film makers. It is perfect. Walter Brennan portrays the best character that ever existed in any film....the one and only stumpy.

1.0,rio_bravo,I've typed many different attempts at writing something for this movie. But nothing does it justice. This film is incredible.
1.0,rio_bravo,"The quintessential cowboy movie, I've seen a lot and they don't get any better than this. Even the 'lamest'(?)part of the movie where Ricky and Deano do a song is damn awesome. Walter Brennan, Johnny Wayne. Say NO MORE!!!"
1.0,rio_bravo,"Seriously everything about this film is perfect. Before, I had heard people call it slow-paced. What a load of bull! The time just floats by. Before, I thought John Ford was the master of the Wester, but after watching this I seriously needed to reconsider."

1.0,rio_bravo,2 or 3 of john wayne!
1.0,rio_bravo,"I have seen Rio Bravo more often than any other film, and it never gets old. Hawks, Wayne and the rest are at the top of their game."
1.0,rio_bravo,"With the steely competence of his adventure films, and the usual upending of the same typical of his comedies, it might be Hawks' richest, most complete film. Certainly Wayne has never been better--and he's easily outdone by Martin and Dickinson."
1.0,rio_bravo,John Wanye and Dean Martin...Think thats says enough! I watched this with my grandad and is the total reason why I love it. [Apart from Wayne and Martin]
1.0,rio_bravo,The best western ever. Period. No discussion.

1.0,jurassic_park,"When you watch this film, you forget that it was made over 20 years ago as the special effects are so superb. It is an adventure suitable for all, as well as providing some classic moments of cinema. Another Spielberg epic. John Williams' score is a masterpiece."

1.0,throne_of_blood,Simply the best adaptation of the classic Shakespeare play.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"10 out of 10:Beautifully filmed, well acted, and exciting, Throne of Blood makes the best adaptation of MacBeth."
1.0,throne_of_blood,One of the best Shakspearean adaptations takes place in feudal Japan. It's impossible to take your eyes off this awe-inspiring masterpiece.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"My second Kurosawa film based on a Shakespearean play. As much as I loved Ran, this i felt was better acted and flowed better as a film."
1.0,throne_of_blood,I shall taint these woods crimsom
1.0,throne_of_blood,A wonderful example of Japanese melodrama.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Not as good as ""Ran"", but Akira Kurosawa is truly the Great Lord of Shakespeare, even as he rests in his grave."
1.0,throne_of_blood,The film was beautiful!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A masterpiece, both as a Shakespeare adaptation and as a moving drama."
1.0,throne_of_blood,MACBETH WITH SAMURAI COULD YOU ASK FOR A MORE AWESOME MOVIE
1.0,throne_of_blood,Arguably the best adaptation of Macbeth ever made.
1.0,throne_of_blood,this is THE in in only Macbeth Film you habe to watch....
1.0,throne_of_blood,a truly masterful retelling of macbeth.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Brilliant in every way
1.0,throne_of_blood,Throne of Blood is my very own introduction to Shakespeare though not the first. The combination of Kurosawa and Mifune is simply unbeatable!
1.0,throne_of_blood,When my literature class of emo-flunkies rates this B&W; 1957 Shakespeare film over Branagh and Gibson...you know something's special about it. Kurosawa was never better and Shakespeare was never dignified as much on screen. Sorry Ken & Larry!
1.0,throne_of_blood,Pretty much perfect.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Haunting in the most visually appealing ways with impressive illusive effects seen in Kurosawa's films. Throne of Blood is very dark and spiritual with a great stage play brought to life. Also, and again, Mifune delivers."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"One of the most fresh, intelligent, visually-effective and purely magnificent takes on the old Shakespeare tale of deceit, greed, and bloodthirsty desires. Mifune and Yamada perform in the most striking and memorable way."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"The first time I saw it, at the end--when a certain forest literally started moving--I thought that Mr. Kurosawa had gone and changed the ending to the bard's play."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa is regarded as one of the great filmmakers of all time, and it's easy to see why. This is a majestic, enthralling film that reinterprets Shakespeare's Macbeth as a bold and truly epic Samurai picture. Hands down a contender for the best adaptation of the Bard ever put to film."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Best Macbeth adaptation ever. Should be a classic on everyone's shelf
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa's samurai retelling of Macbeth is brilliantly evocative and legend has it Mifune seriously risked his life making the ending. Repeated viewings make his villainous character appear more sympathetic.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Mifune again is superb as in Seven Samurai. This time the tradgedy of Macbeth translated into the Japanese medium and it is superbly handled. The ending is incredible and the film haunting from start to finish, Kurosawa's vision is beautiful, haunting and epic."
1.0,throne_of_blood,An amazing adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth. Set in feudal Japan with Kurosawa regular Toshiro Mifune masterly taking the lead role accompanied by by equally stunning screen performance by Isuzu Yamada as his wife. The ending has to be seen to be believed and has not been bettered to this day.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa's version of Macbeth---a feast for the eye--wonderful, a perfect movie, and true to the feeling of the original Shakespeare play"
1.0,throne_of_blood,A magnificent adapttion of the Shakespeare`s play!
1.0,throne_of_blood,It?s a must see! It?s shows how silence sometimes speaks louder than any word!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"The best version of any Shakespearian play on film, despite it being Macbeth transplanted to feudal Japan. Amazing in every respect!"
1.0,throne_of_blood,Amazing adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth. Probably a more Shakespearean film than nearly all the traditional movies of the bard's works. Must see.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Along with Seven Samurai, Kurosawa's best."
1.0,throne_of_blood,My only exposure to Shakespeare is through Kurosawa...
1.0,throne_of_blood,THRONE OF BLOOD (1957)
1.0,throne_of_blood,Perhaps Kurosawa's masterpiece.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Brilliant re-telling of Macbeth and one of Kurasawa'a best.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Toshrio MiFune is wonderful and just brilliant. and wow what an ending. officially in my three endings of all time
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Wonderful, robust classic Japanese retelling of ""Macbeth."" Beautifully filmed and boldly acted, with a chilling musical score. One of the greatest Shakespeare adaptations you will ever see."
0.0,throne_of_blood,I cared about Macbeth as a tragic figure. Washizu can suck arrow.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A Japanese classic, Kurosawa's adaptation of Macbeth."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"One of the very best Shakespeare adaptations. Akira Kurosawa not only retells the story to perfection but he also blends the themes of the original with his own themes and Japanese history, just as well as he did with his much later film Ran."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"The Shakespearean influence is obviously there, not only in story, but the film itself has a very theatre-esque feeling to it. The ending was fantastic. One of Kurosawa's best films."
1.0,throne_of_blood,A fantastic film adaptation of MacBeth's play in which fog and tangled forest webs emphasize the limits on man's foresight.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Macbeth set in feudal Japan, just brilliant. Mifune, as ever and I loved Isuzu Yamada as Lady Macbeth, still and emotionless steadily egging him on to his doom."
1.0,throne_of_blood,A brilliant adaptation on an epic scale.
1.0,throne_of_blood,The best film adaptation of Shakespeare ever. Incredible film.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"If theres a better film adaptation from a shakespear play (maybe Ran, but its a close call) than throne of bllod, I'd love to see it. Throne of blood is creepy, stunning, and masterfully made. Theres alot of depth behind the main characters, and its not just another re-telling of a shakespear play."
1.0,throne_of_blood,A great adaptation by Kurosawa of MacBeth. This movie will stand alone from other Kurosawa films because it is a different kind of story(with the exception of Ran)from the gunslinger fashioned ronin samurai.
1.0,throne_of_blood,A great adaptation of a great Shakespearian play. Stunning cinematography and acting. Very true to the play with only one significant change in the ending. But the change is (dare I say) better than the original. Recommended for anyone who likes Shakespeare.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Brilliant! Kurosawa's version of Macbeth in a samurai style.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Toshiro Mifune, Isuzu Yamada, Takashi Shimura, and Minoru Chiaki star in one of the many highlights of Akira Kurosawa's career."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"This fast, fun action film from legendary director Akira Kurosawa is a fascinating re-telling of Shakespeare's MACBETH, as set in feudal Japan."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Another masterpiece of a film by Akira Kurosawa. A fantastically unique take on Shakespeare's Macbeth starring the powerful force that is Toshiro Mifune.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Izvanredno. Ritam je jos bolji nego u Rashomonu, cini mi se. Uistinu dramatican film. Nema slabe tocke. Sad jos da procitam Macbeth..."
1.0,throne_of_blood,this movie rocked! I forgot how much I love kurasawa movies
1.0,throne_of_blood,so incredibly moody. fantastic performance by mifune.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"It's like watching the Psycho shower scene on repeat! So extreme and horrifying and messy, but so brilliant."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa never did any wrong when it came to making movies, especially with his favorite actor Mifune on his side."
0.0,throne_of_blood,"As much as I normally love Kurasowa, I just couldn't get through this. Maybe someday I'll give it another chance."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Arguably the finest cinematic adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth and one of Kurosawa's best films.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Better than Shakespeare!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa's best ever ! He highlighted perfectly the mystical dimension of Macbeth.Toshiro Mifune is amazing : a warlord returning from the battlefield to his homeland, fighting against his destiny ; against himself and his own craziness...Untill the end, which is totally apocalyptical."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"You put Toshiro Mifune, Akira Kurosawa, and a Shakespeare story together in a room and it's going to take a lot for it not to be fantastic."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Can Macbeth get any better than this? Loved the scene with the moving forest. Wow.
1.0,throne_of_blood,I love this film!!! There has never been a greater actor than Mifune Toshiro. Shakespeare should be proud.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A bona-fide Kurosawa masterpiece. Epic in its scope, its themes, its origins in Shakespeare and Noh theatre, and its lead performance by the walking supernova himself, Toshiro Mifune."
1.0,throne_of_blood,A brilliant adaptation of Macbeth set in feudal Japan. Incredibly directed by Akira Kurosawa. Absolutely stunning...which is to be expected from Kurosawa.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Probably the best adaptation of Macbeth put on screen. Kurosawa at his greatest and with powerhouse performances. The forest scene is absolutely unforgettable: the Bard would be ecstatic.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Simply sublime Cinema
1.0,throne_of_blood,By far the best version of Macbeth that I have seen. Toshiro Mifune is amazing in this role.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"to be(st ran) or not to be(st throne of blood), this is the question !!!!"
1.0,throne_of_blood,Great Kurosawa movie based on Macbeth. The final death scene was amazing and the special effects of the spirits are really cool too. The acting of Toshiro Mifune is always great. The costumes are pretty amazing too.
1.0,throne_of_blood,questions:you can act with just movement? the directors job is to anticipate human emotion? noh theatre: far is close?
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa turned Shakespeare's Macbeth into an amazing film!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A+. A version of Shakespeare's Macbeth, just in the samurai era."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Possibly the best film adaptation of Shakespeare ever. Definitely the best free interpretation, and the most cinematic."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa's compelling ""samurai"" adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth. This isn't just a typical retelling of the story or a film version of the stage play, this is much more of a character study with surprising depth and motivation. An epic film, in every sense of the word."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa's adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth. Stunning for it's time with a surreal feel to it and a story full of metaphors. A masterpiece.17 January 2009
1.0,throne_of_blood,"That evil spirit in the forest could have suggested Washizu get a divorce, but noooooo"
1.0,throne_of_blood,This is actually the first film by Akira Kurosawa that I have ever saw in my life. Kurosawa brilliantly combines the same human elements of Shakesphere's tragedy MacBeth with Japanese history.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A very moving and intense treatment of Shakespeare's Macbeth. Kurasawa was a master at translating Shakespeare into Japanese culture. Mifune is terrific. Very stylistic, though, and not for everyone."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Best Shakespeare adaptation ever (followed closely by 'Ran'). Mifune's final scenes in the film are cenima at its very finest
1.0,throne_of_blood,Easily the greatest screen adaptation of Macbeth (despite the plot adjustments)
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Not so much a tragedy as it is an unrelenting nightmare. I've always found Toshiro Mifune's acting to be somewhat exaggerated, but here his ferocious paranoia is perfectly suited to the role."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"My personal favorite among Kurosawa's film. Haunting, surreal and nightmarish, this is Kurosawa's darkest film yet. Mifune's best performance in my opinion."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"great atmosphere, love the human pincushion ending"
1.0,throne_of_blood,"If not for ""Seven Samurai"" this would be Kurosawas best film period."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa coordinates the best adaptation of Macbeth on-screen and Mifune is orgiastic in the lead role.What more can you ask when you're watching two legends dancing to the cinematic rhythm?
1.0,throne_of_blood,It's Kurosawa - It's Shakespeare. What else is there left to say!
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa. Mifune. Shakespeare. I don't know what else you want from here. Another one of my undisputed favorites.I wanna be buried with this movie.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Adaptacion cinematografica de ""Macbeth"" (Shakespeare), probablemente la mejor que se haya hecho. El teatro Kabuki y Noh construyen las actuaciones, y la ultima escena es una de las cosas mas impresionantes que un ser humano puede ver."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Greatest film adaptation of MacBeth. Dark and haunting. The visuals will stick with you for a long time.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Macbeth, Kurosawa style. Fantastic."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Akira Kurosawa's outstanding treatment of Shakespeare's MacBeth set in medieval Japan.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa takes Macbeth by the horns and makes it his servant. The master never disappointed.
1.0,throne_of_blood,It's MacBeth with Samurais. It fooking perfect.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Haunting images and wrenching story make this a standout Kurosawa.
1.0,throne_of_blood,this is always worth another viewing!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Need I explain myself? This movie ""Kumonosu jo as it is called in Japanese is Akira Kurosawa's Magbeth! There can be no parellel to kurosawa in film history, and yes, this movie casts Toshiro Mifune."
1.0,throne_of_blood,The best Shakespeare adaptation I've ever seen. Kurosawa at his best without a doubt. The way that Kurosawa compensates for the language problems with the superb and subtle actions is genius.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurasawa directs Mifune in Japanese adaptation of the ""Scottish Play."""
1.0,throne_of_blood,Greatest finale ever? Maybe Mifune's finest performance.
1.0,throne_of_blood,A completely wonderful Shakespearian adaptation. One of Kurosawa's best. Toshiro Minfune is just amazing...as usual.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Throne of Blood is one of the few truly great movies that makes me excited for the possibilities of film rather than depressed at the failures.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"YES! YES! YES! Kurosawa's samurai version of Macbeth is beyond brilliant: creepy, surreal, beautiful, and riveting."

1.0,throne_of_blood,The best verison of Macbeth out there.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa's take on Macbeth. Gruesome, violent and superbly acted. This is one you will not forget. The Lady Macbeth character in this movie is a wonderful precursor to the one in RAN."

1.0,throne_of_blood,One of Kurosawa's best. Possibly the most visceral screen adaptation of shakespeare yet.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"This is Kurosawa's ""Macbeth"" . The language of Shakespeare is missing but the power, evil and terror are there. The ending is jaw-dropping. A reporter asked Mifune how he managed to look so terrified during the final scene. ""Because I WAS terrified,"" he answered."
1.0,throne_of_blood,I have seen many versions of Macbeth. Kurosawa did a wonderful job retelling the story in this samauri tale. Wow! Kurosawa never fails..

1.0,throne_of_blood,Yes. My favorite movie all time.
1.0,throne_of_blood,The visuals alone are worth the watching....
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Oddly, this is a scary-ass interpretation of Macbeth...Isuzu Yamada might be the scariest person in history."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"another unlikely yet fully successful mix. kurosawa's vision of macbeth is, as always, breathtaking."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Hommes trop faibles, femmes trop fortes... le pouvoir n'est jamais dans les mains de celui qu'on croit (Cf RAN pour confirmer cette histoire)."

1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa's Macbeth. Haunting and spectacular.
1.0,throne_of_blood,an obscenely subtle movie - shakespeare in a kabuki mask. one of my fav kurosawa films
1.0,throne_of_blood,Another Shakespeare insipred Kurosawa film.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"One of my favorite Kurosawa films, and one of my favorite Shakespeare adaptations. Maniacal Noh-inspired performances, ultra spooky sets and lighting, and a finale to make one quiver all over, so to speak..."
1.0,throne_of_blood,It's Macbeth in Japan. Phenomenal story and characters. If you know Shakespeare then this film is really fun to watch to see how everything is translated through
1.0,throne_of_blood,Shakespeare in Asia.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Just great shots and superb acting. Best adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth and one of the greatest Movies ever.

1.0,throne_of_blood,My second favorite cinematic adaptation of Shakespeare (right behind Strange Brew).
1.0,throne_of_blood,"This movie is so creepy and good--it's like Shakespeare should have been Japanese. I mean, it's amazing. Superb attention to detail; lots of authentic samurai garb and traditional Japanese music."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Yes it is Macbeth, and yes it is done right. You can really see Kurosawa's experiences as a painter show through in the chase scene with the witch."
1.0,throne_of_blood,awesome play of shadows!!!!!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa doesn't need one more person blowing smoke up his ass, but this is by far one of my favorite adaptations of Shakespeare. If you haven't seen it then you should, if you don't want to see it you're an asshole and should kill yourself."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"The final image of Kurosawa's Macbeth character, played by Toshiro Mifune, captures all that is tragic in the warrior-king. Another of Kurosawa's brilliant war films, Throne of Blood is the best reimagining of Shakespeare to come along until Ran, nearly thirty years later."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa's best film, in my opinion. One of his bloodiest, if not the bloodiest. I saw ""Macbeth"" on stage in London earlier this year and I think ""throne of Blood"" is the definitive retelling of that play. This film is breathtaking!"
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A great chance to see a master filmmaker and a world-class actor change everything you thought you knew about ... well, something that resembles Shakespeare."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Akira Kurosawa directs this amazing retelling of Macbeth. Toshiro Mifune (Washizu) is totally believable as the betrayer, while Isuzu Yamada (as Washizu's wife) is haunting as the distraught wife.There is no better production of Macbeth in any form than this movie."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Without a doubt my favorite Kurosawa film. Has everything that makes him great.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Shot beautifully, the contrasts are unreal, the portrayal of Yama-uba is horrifying. Truly great film."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa likes to create his own tales from others before him, and others do the same with Kurosawa's work, this time, he tackles Shakespeare and Macbeth. This is a fine masterpiece, its a great visual take and a deep powerful take rooted in the annuals of time."
1.0,throne_of_blood,the awesome toshiro mifune turned into a sieve in an amazing ending. great shakespeare!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Welles's was like a bad speed trip- - -sweaty, agit. Polanski gutted it, spilt blood. But Kurosawa, he spooked Macbeth up. Into hallucination, into ghost story, into fever dream. So he wins."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Its a really good and creepy interpretation of Macbeth. Its spooky!!!!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Stunning realisation - the fortress and battles, are stunning, in a typical Kurosawa stylee."

1.0,throne_of_blood,Maybe my favorite Kurosawa film.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa tackles Shakespeare's MacBeth. A precursor to his masterpiece Ran is almost as visceral and intriguing. This is the coldest film I have seen by Kurosawa with one of the most powerful and well executed endings of his whole library.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Oustanding photography and filming
1.0,throne_of_blood,In my opinion this is one of the only two truly great film adaptations of Macbeth.

1.0,throne_of_blood,Great Japanese adaption of MacBeth. This is easily one of Toshiro Mifune's greatest works.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"amazing imagery. Toshiro Mufune finest moment. The ""Lady Macbeth"" character in her kimono slithering about like a snake was also amazing."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"One of the most perfect Macbeths I have ever seen - despite not having a scrap of Shakespeare in the script. Ferociously powerful, hauntingly believable brilliance."
1.0,throne_of_blood,A magnificent adaptation of that Scottish play (Macbeth)! One of Kurosawa's best!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A take on Shakespeare's Macbeth that captures the violent power of the story. It lacks the poetry of Shakespeare's verse, but the surreal imagery is a fine compensation. The scene in the Cobweb forest with the weird ""sister"" is so creepy. lovelovelove"
1.0,throne_of_blood,Japanese samurai version of MacBeth. Somewhat experimental and very classic.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa's best film, and the best Macbeth adaptation ever made."
1.0,throne_of_blood,?lskar samurajaction. ?lskar Akira Kurosawa!
1.0,throne_of_blood,and i usually find shakespeare boring
1.0,throne_of_blood,Brilliant. A testament to the truth that Shakespeare's works reach their greatest heights when adapted rather than revered.
1.0,throne_of_blood,All i can say is WOW.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A brilliant adaption of macbeth, probably the best, even though it takes place in a japanese setting. Kurosawa tells the story in a dark and gritty manner, that it's thrilling and scary!"
1.0,throne_of_blood,Too bad it's not in color!!!
1.0,throne_of_blood,An amazing telling of the Macbeth story. I completely recommend this not just for the samurai movie fans but for the Shakespear fans as well.

1.0,throne_of_blood,Competes for top position of a Shakespeare adaptation on film

1.0,throne_of_blood,Lady Macbeth at her most devious
1.0,throne_of_blood,"One of his real classics... the highlight is the way each frame is designed to communicate and awake all your senses... its composition, music and the costumes.."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa brings his unerring eye for indelible images to Shakespeare in this 1957 adaptation of Macbeth. By changing the locale from Birnam Wood to 16th-century Japan, Kurosawa makes an oddball argument for the trans-historicity of Shakespeare's narrative. Amazing acting and soundtrack."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa's best movie IMO
1.0,throne_of_blood,"In my opinion, this film shows mifune at his finest. My favourite ever Shakespeare adaptation, only just beating Ran."

1.0,throne_of_blood,"One of Kurosawa's best. Also, it is one of Toshiro Mifune's best performances. God knows you can't beat the ending."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"The greatest screen version of Shakespeare I've ever seen (and I've seen too many...). Kurosawa's distillation of Macbeth captures the tautness and muscularity of Shakespeare's play brilliantly, and Mifune's performance is quite possibly his best."
1.0,throne_of_blood,The master himself amking one of the best Shakespeare adaptation to screen ever...I mean wow!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was a time of light, it was a time of darkness, Kurosawa exploring the duality of a mind and the versatility of life."

1.0,throne_of_blood,I think this may be Kurosawa's best Shakespeare adaptation.

1.0,throne_of_blood,"Now, that's a Lady M!"
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa retells Macbeth. Mifune brings it to life and risks his life (for real) to tell this tale. One of many movies that I believe everyone should see.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Shakespeare's Macbeth set in fuedal Japan, with suitable twists and cultural modifications to make this a genuine story all its own. The ending is superb. Now if only the real Macbeth were this interesting!"
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Visually its amazing, Mifune's acting is stark and so confident. This movie along with ""I Live in Fear"" just cements Mifune as my favourite actor. Its hard to pick a favourite Kurosawa film but this one keeps coming out on top. Its definitely his creepiest."

1.0,throne_of_blood,Macbeth by Kurosawa. A superb film with great acting
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A masterpiece of cinema, from the master Kurosawa. One of the greatest endings ever filmed."

1.0,throne_of_blood,amazing adaptation of macbeth in black and white samurai times. spoiler - they shot real arrows at him at the end!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa's take on Macbeth is nothing short of brilliant. Toshiro Mifune's lead performance is gripping and amazing, as always, and the action and cinematography are first-rate."

1.0,throne_of_blood,"The best Shakespeare adaptation ever, and soooo much better than The Seven Samurai."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa directs this best Shakespeare adaptation ever.Mifune stars as a man driven mad with power etc.The scene when the Trees come to life is still frighteningly real and effective. I have no idea how they pulled off an effect like that back in '57.
1.0,throne_of_blood,almost as brilliant as Kurosawa's more celebrated 'Rashomon'. it's almost impossible to fault this brilliant adaptation of Shakespeare's 'Macbeth'.

1.0,logan_2017,"Changes the way we look at the X-Men, it may be depressing but that's just like real life so suck it up other reviewers!"

1.0,logan_2017,"To put it bluntly, ""This ain't your daddy's X-Men."" Logan is a violent, bloody, and gory film about Hugh Jackman's final bow as one of the most enduring characters in Comic Book films. A definite must see not just for fans of X-Men/Wolverine, but anyone who is a film-noir buff."
1.0,logan_2017,"A fantastic comic book movie that is also a fantastic movie, this film shows the dark side of characters we have loved for years yet we can't help but care for them in this dark and wonderfully told tale. A riveting work of cinema."
1.0,logan_2017,"Logan's final stand is a compelling, grim and dark tale with a grounded story and lovable characters. You can't help but feel Logan and company's agony and hardship as they go through many challenges to live a better life."
1.0,logan_2017,"Perfect send-off for Hugh Jackman's 17 year run as The Wolverine. It's gritty, emotional, and extremely satisfying. Loved every minute of it."
1.0,logan_2017,"""Logan"" is one of the year's best. ""Logan"" is now my favorite hero movie. James Mangold creates the elegy of the hero in mortality and ultimately love. Hugh Jackman is powerful and nuanced-- his best performance. Dafne Keen is awesome-- she is the new star."
0.0,logan_2017,"Boring.Lots of violence, but without inspiring, in the viewer, a desire for justice/vengence or of fear for the protagonists.The characters are unlikeable.. The plot uninspired and predictable."

0.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,"A psychedelic waste pit of ugly UA animation, a song the only makes sense if you are on LSD, an bad acting."
1.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,"It's visuals may not be of the comprehension of some viewers (inluding me) but that can't remove the fact that Yellow Submarine is more than a musical, it's an authentic piece of art. Even many years after it's release, it has the same magic."
1.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,Endlessly inventive animation invigorates this tale of the Beatles saving a psychadelic fantasy land from a nasty horde of invaders. The images stagger the imagination and overall the film serves as the perfect complement to the Fab Four's late 60's material.
1.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,My favorite movie ever!
1.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,"""Yellow Submarine (1968)"" is one of the most imaginative and psychedelic animation films of all time, especially when you count the music of The Beatles."

1.0,1005973-diva,Brilliant little film.
1.0,1005973-diva,"The most accessably enjoyable serious art film I've ever seen. Very surprised this is so widely forgotten. Saw it in the theatre when it was new, and it has definitely held up over the years."
1.0,1005973-diva,"A movie that manages to capture a spine tingling stillness and beauty through its distinctive chromatic palette, it's magical backdrop, and it's slightly staged acting.An indulgent, meloncholc masterpiece. A film for a rainy winter's afternoon."
1.0,1005973-diva,"Beautiful...Spectacular... A Masterpiece. A post punk french film which, in my opinion, closes out the French 'new wave' of cinema."
1.0,1005973-diva,Wonderfully filmed and acted with an interestingly diverse cast.

1.0,1005973-diva,One of the most beautifully filmed movies of all time with an incredible sound track
1.0,1005973-diva,"I saw this film when it first came out in the cinemas, have seen it since on DVd, and even now the trailer still gives me goosebumps (but does not do the movie justice). In parts it's a satire of the French ""new wave"" cinema. See the whole movie! It's fun, quirky, & romantic."

1.0,1005973-diva,The score. The chic. '60s French New Wave updated to '80s New Wave.
1.0,1005973-diva,"Even if the film had nothing else to offer, Wilhelmenia Wiggins Fernandez's haunting soprano arias give this film an irresistible, other-worldly feel. A dream-like, off-kilter film about obsession, kept on track with its subtle, off-beat humor."
1.0,1005973-diva,"One of my all time favorite movies. Every frame is gorgeous, the story is engaging and suspenseful. Characters that are truly unique."
1.0,1005973-diva,This was the movie Red picked. It is almost 17 years to the day from the moment we watched our favorite picks together.
1.0,1005973-diva,My favourite all time move (and also turned me on to opera). Just don't take it too seriously ... fantastic scene where Jules plays Alba his bootleg recording of 'La Wally' by Cynthia Hawkins.
1.0,1005973-diva,Best movie ever ... when I was 17
1.0,1005973-diva,"fantastic,but dont watch the dubbed version.This film has so much style and story,the moped chase is outstanding and locations are excellent.Make sure you have the subtitles on it adds to the films aura. The operatic talents of Wilhelmenia Fernandez are amazing and captivating."

1.0,1005973-diva,80's french new wave....love it!

1.0,1005973-diva,SO glad this is now out on DVD. I keenly remember seeing it my freshman year of college and just being blown away. An essential New Wave '80s movie.

1.0,1005973-diva,This movie is one of the most beautiful movies I have seen in a while. It stays with you long after the final image has faded from the screen.
1.0,1005973-diva,This film is the shit
1.0,1005973-diva,My very first foreign film and it was fantastic. And I've been hooked on foreign films ever since.

1.0,1005973-diva,The coolest movie ever.
1.0,1005973-diva,"Yeah, it's embarrassing that it's been one of my favorites since I was 14. Then again, it's freaking fantastic. Noir galore. Enjoy it. Will make you want love, and to see an opera."
1.0,1005973-diva,another great movie by Luc Bresson
0.0,1005973-diva,This film's glamorization of pedophilia and celebrity stalking seems more and more offensive with each passing year.
1.0,1005973-diva,"i have to say it, it's very french. beautiful scenes and color (i love all of the lighting, and jules' warehouse space is very cool), wilhelmenia fernandez's incredible voice, and great attention to detail add to the twisted plot."
1.0,1005973-diva,Gorgeous and gripping. 'nuff said.
1.0,1005973-diva,Great movie! Love the lofts.
1.0,1005973-diva,got to the film forum asap! cool and funny
1.0,1005973-diva,"Perhaps the most picturesque film to come out of France in years, unified by the extraordinary decor - colour supplement chic meets pop art surrealism - which creates a world of totally fantastic reality situated four-square in contemporary Paris."
1.0,1005973-diva,"So... French. Beautiful, scary, fluffy."
1.0,1005973-diva,best movie i have seen up to date

1.0,1005973-diva,great film for it's time and still as good today.
1.0,1005973-diva,"Rolig, sp?¡ènnande, vacker och underlig... ja, den h?¡èr filmen har det mesta."
1.0,1005973-diva,"One of the first films that took me out of my seat and into the screen..ambient, beautiful, emotive, disconnected and stylish"
1.0,1005973-diva,"A fun, cool French movie with a postman, gangsters, and an opera diva."
1.0,1005973-diva,An action film directed with space in it. One of the most memorable scenes is buttering a baguette. You won't see that in a Steven Seagal movie.
1.0,1005973-diva,The story is as relevant today as then; and the cinematography is amazing.
1.0,1005973-diva,"A crazy French thriller, a prime example of la cinema du look. Classic Vespa chase. ONLY a French action movie would have a Vespa chase."
1.0,1005973-diva,"I love this movie more than any other. Watch it whenever I'm feeling bad about life. Unbelievably beautiful, fun and smart."
1.0,1005973-diva,"A brilliant French thriller cleverly deals with copyright issues, as the performance of an opera diva is taped without approval. Suddenly everybody's after the bootleg tape. Watch out, Jules!"
1.0,1005973-diva,"just cool, and super music"
1.0,1005973-diva,Would love to see it again. I just remember it being visually magnificent and VERY funny.
1.0,1005973-diva,when I saw it the first time it was the coolest and best film ever. Having seen it acouple if times more recently it becomes clear how much before its time it was
1.0,1005973-diva,"Fabulous, loads of plot twists, cool Zen man and the best car in the world!"
1.0,1005973-diva,this is about respect & love of music
1.0,1005973-diva,Ice-cool and absorbing mystery wrapped around 2 tapes and as many love stories...
1.0,1005973-diva,"One of my all-time faves for its great music and ""french-ness"". A classic."
1.0,1005973-diva,The coolest film for a style conscious cat
1.0,1005973-diva,"Still awesome after all these years - the music, the plot and the gorgeous cinematography make this a real treat."
1.0,1005973-diva,"COOL Just COOL -- This is the best of the free-wheeling optimistic, liberal, open-minded 80's France. The last good big-bucks French movie ever made (sighs...)"
1.0,1005973-diva,25 years later it is still fantastic to see again.
1.0,1005973-diva,"Visually stunning, hyperkinetic thriller has it all. It's a shame that Wilhelmina Wiggins-Fernandez (the diva herself) cannot act -- but she has such a transcendent voice that it hardly matters. Every other aspect is perfect."
1.0,1005973-diva,Lovely film with odd characters + a very nice sound track.
1.0,1005973-diva,BRILLIANT movie - one of my all time greats
1.0,1005973-diva,Beineix! Not your typical French film. A bit of brooding but mostly great fun...
1.0,1005973-diva,"Beautiful, intelligent, surprising, funny, subtle - just make sure you are watching the original or a well synchronized version. Sub-titles spoil it all."
1.0,1005973-diva,"A 1980s movie that is pure art. Amazing soundtrack, beautiful scenery, quirky characters, artfully shot. What it lacks in substance (and in the acting talents of operatic talent Ms. Fernandez), it more than makes up for in style and thrills. One of my all-time favorites."
1.0,1005973-diva,Den kj?lige elegansen kombinert med vakker opera og filming slo meg i bakken
1.0,1005973-diva,"This film is saturated with Wilhelmenia Wiggins Fernandez's divine operatic vocals. The cast of French oddities have never been bettered, with a roller skating teenage thief, a postal worker who loves opera but steals the diva's dress and a hippy recluse who is trying to make the perfect baguette."
1.0,1005973-diva,A stylish visual and musical feast.
1.0,1005973-diva,"the film that got me into scooters, opera, and baghettes with caviar.. have never looked back"
1.0,1005973-diva,They don't come any better than this
1.0,1005973-diva,Watch as a double bill with Subway. This is a teenage 'i'm so alternative' staple. Helped make me feel special...
1.0,1005973-diva,Un autre de mes films fetiches
1.0,1005973-diva,It built up its reputation in over a year of cinema release before it became a massive hit. That just would not be possible now.
1.0,1005973-diva,This movie is so beautifully made and the story is so engaging and DIFFERENT even though the theme is universal. I also love the soundtrack.
1.0,1005973-diva,je n'aime pas Beethoven
1.0,1005973-diva,This was one of my favourite films. I have watched it a ridiculous number of times. Had the soundtrack as well. Saw Wilhelmena Fernandez live in concert. She was as good in person as in the film. Read the book and others that this was based on.
1.0,1005973-diva,Serioulsy cool film. The theme song is out of this world.
1.0,1005973-diva,Beineix's first film - simply stunning - could watch it again and again. PS the trick of wearing a mask and snorkel to chop onions does not work!
1.0,1005973-diva,"A wonderful, stylish ride"
1.0,1005973-diva,classic 80s French film
1.0,1005973-diva,25 years and still my favorite movie of all time.....paris.....sigh
1.0,1005973-diva,This was a very compelling thriller and I loved every minute of it. I loved the subplots and the intrincate makeup of the whole story. The motorcycle chase and the opera singing was extraordinary. I am not a fan of opera but she made you want to listen to opera! What a voice!
1.0,1005973-diva,My favourite Paris film ever - Paris in the 80s without being cleaned up by Jeunet. Music by way of Opera and cigarettes by way of Gitanes. Beautiful
1.0,1005973-diva,"One of the most beautiful pieces of celluloid ever! Grace Bumbry the femme fatale who is the object of desire for a crazed fan, who decides to take matters into his own hands."
1.0,1005973-diva,"Existentialist thriller, what's not to like?"
1.0,1005973-diva,I love the music... the movie is sick
1.0,1005973-diva,"An amazing French thriller from the early 80s. Great acting, suspense, and action sequences."
1.0,1005973-diva,Cinema du look at its best.
1.0,1005973-diva,"One of my top 10 movies. It is beautiful, quirky, flawed, and ultimately, brilliant."
1.0,1005973-diva,"Murder, conspiracy, opera, mopeds ... and everyone lives in really cool apartments. If I ever manage to visit France in my lifetime, it's going to be such a letdown."
1.0,1005973-diva,One of my all time favorites! Brilliant! Multi-level agenda. Intelligent!
1.0,1005973-diva,"Although it will likely not age well, this is one of my favourites. A new-wave tale of mistaken identity."
1.0,1005973-diva,"Darling French boys, girls on rollerskates, and, yes, the Zen Master... truly one of the best movies ever made."
1.0,1005973-diva,Love French New Wave!
1.0,1005973-diva,"One of the most creative story lines ever, and as abstract as France can get."
1.0,1005973-diva,"If you like weird European movies with great music, you'll love this one."
1.0,1005973-diva,I saw this originally in french class in high school. I thought it was the coolest movie I've ever seen. It was.
1.0,1005973-diva,The protagonist Jules is who I wanted to be in high school. La Wally is the most beautiful piece of music still.
1.0,1005973-diva,Classic. Period. Wilhemenia Higgins Hernandez rocks.

1.0,all_is_lost_2013,"Minimalism is, in my opinion, the key characteristic to a great, effective and realistic survival film. Redford being the only character in the story, with about four lines of dialogue and not a single location on-screen based on land equals a new-found gem in the genre."
1.0,all_is_lost_2013,"Ridiculously good! No dialog. No one but Redford. But it is tense and you find yourself experiencing the up and downs of his disaster with him. Very well acted and absolutely engrossing. If you liked Castaway, you will like this one."

1.0,goldfinger,"Hard to imagine this movie is almost 50 years old. Has stood the test of time well. Still exciting, still relevant. Sean Connery is at his peak, as is this Bond film which falls second (possibly) only to Casino Royale."

1.0,goldfinger,Best Bond movie ever.
1.0,goldfinger,"What can't you say about this movie? It has everything, and is wonderfully cheesy and camp. This is Bond when Bond was allowed to be Bond, before he had to go on some kind of existentialist quest to save the world, and instead, could fight evil gold-obsessed bad guys."
1.0,goldfinger,The most iconic film of the Connery era and beyond.
1.0,goldfinger,Classic Bond at its best. Bond's classic witticisms really begin here. Memorable villains and Bond girls. The Aston Martin DB5 is introduced with its many gadgets in use here.

1.0,captain_america_civil_war,I thought civil war is the best captain America / avengers movie yet the combination of characters in civil war is great from classics like iron man to newer characters like black panther or spider man
1.0,captain_america_civil_war,Civil War is a terrific addition to the MCU that deftly handles a well crafted plot and the introduction of several key characters.
1.0,captain_america_civil_war,The very best Marvel movie. Great story
1.0,captain_america_civil_war,This franchise keeps getting better and better. And Marvel keeps taking the super hero genre to the next level. DC? Not so much.
1.0,captain_america_civil_war,Best Marvel effort to date. Civil War shows that superhero movies don't need to rely on humanity-ending stakes with the clich¨¨ explosions and big action scenes to be compelling.
0.0,captain_america_civil_war,How can fools watch a stupid film like this but avoid a MASTERPIECE like Kubo and the two stings? This movie is garbage! Only ONE FILM this year has been great and that film was Kubo!!!

0.0,captain_america_civil_war,"Another weak villain, too many characters, only one half decent action scene at the airport. Terrible to watch on a second watch."
1.0,captain_america_civil_war,The intro to black panther was insane!!! When they show that helicopter emptying bullets on him and hes not even budging! Marvel has officially found an image. Kill the X-men and stick to avengers and the cosmic universe.

0.0,captain_america_civil_war,Buenas secuencias de acci¨®n pero eso no quita la p¨¦sima direcci¨®n de los hermanos Russo y esta pel¨ªcula prueba que Batman v Superman y Suicide Squad son mejores que estas porquer¨ªas.
1.0,captain_america_civil_war,"This is a really good movie, right mixture of comedy, action and drama. Well done."
1.0,one_false_move,"A smart movie with well fleshed-out characters and music that adds to the story in effective ways. There's a lot of violence and the ending is a bit abrupt, but those aren't criticisms as much as observations. All around a solid thumbs up. R.I.P., Bill Paxton."
1.0,one_false_move,"Billy Bob Thornton and Tom Epperson have written a violent crime thriller, directed by first-timer Carl Franklin who expertly guides us in a threateningly mounting wave of suspense until the astoundingly powerful dramatic finale."
1.0,one_false_move,Nobody saw it but it was the thriller of the year. Good stuff
1.0,one_false_move,very enthralling cop drama with all the stops. great film for a first time director. gritty and full of suspense. perfect roles for Both Bill's. very good build up all the way through. great character building.
0.0,one_false_move,The characters and dialogue is cliche and uninteresting so much so that I could not even watch the entire film. Boring. Dull. Predictable. Irritating.
1.0,one_false_move,No doubt this is one of the best ever pragmatic film noir ever made.
1.0,one_false_move,"simple plot, great cast, excellent performance by Billy Bob.."
1.0,one_false_move,"Wow, why have I never seen this movie?"
1.0,one_false_move,Great performances and screenplay (co-written by co-star Billy Bob Thornton) along with a biting criticism of race relations in the rural south. The ending is devastating but strangely beautiful at the same time.
1.0,one_false_move,"by no mean's am i much for billy bob thorton, but this movie is really interesting & has a pretty good cast, to boot!"
1.0,one_false_move,I just love that film! Bill Paxton's best performance! Among my favorite films of all time!

1.0,one_false_move,One of the best movies that nobody has ever seen.
1.0,one_false_move,Great thriller. Bill Paxton is wonderfully sympathetic as the small town cop. Wonderfully acted written and directed. Not as well known as it deserves to be.

1.0,one_false_move,Incredibly taut and dark thriller brilliantly directed by Carl Franklin and intelligently scripted by Billy Bob Thornton. Compelling throughout and with a climax that hits all the right buttons.
1.0,one_false_move,Most intense first 10 minutes of any movie...great neo-noir!
1.0,one_false_move,"A real good thriller, Bill Paxton is real good as is Billy Bob throton who co-wrote the movie."
1.0,one_false_move,A very great Independent film starring Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton. A small town sheriff works with big city detectives to catch 3 criminals on their way to the town. A well down and well acted drama for everyone to see.
1.0,one_false_move,Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton turn in great roles. Smart crime film.
1.0,one_false_move,Here's another film rating.
0.0,one_false_move,one of the worst movies I have ever seen
1.0,one_false_move,Thought it was great the first time that I saw it and it stood up on the second and third viewing. It had some technical problems. The killing in the first part of the movie would have warranted a much larger police response than a coouple of cops driving across the country. But still.

1.0,wall_e,El futuro de la humanidad hecho pel¨ªcula

1.0,wall_e,"If this isn't Pixar's best film, then i'll eat my shoes."
1.0,wall_e,This is a gray movie all about a lonely robot called Wall?¡¤E.

1.0,wall_e,"For a film that only had two spoken words for the first half, this film is a masterpiece."

1.0,wall_e,Wall-E and EVE told the a beautiful love story without a single word.

1.0,wall_e,I challenge anyone to watch this and not fall for Wall¡¤e!
1.0,wall_e,"Wall-E is beautifully made and it manages to tell a love story without any dialogue at all (something which Up did the next year to the tenth degree). It's brilliant, but what keeps it from being my favorite is the perhaps overbearing themes throughout."
1.0,wall_e,Best animated film ever!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,wall_e,"Designed to tug at your heartstrings, but done with such nuanced flair, I wish I could give it a bonus star."
1.0,wall_e,A film you can never get tired of.
1.0,wall_e,It has a GREAT message and the animation is a fantastic example of how far Disney has come.
1.0,wall_e,"If you can get past the obvious politicalism and ignore the poor fat people jokes, this one is hillarious! Oh, and be sure to catch the short ""Presto"" before Wall-e starts. Get that popcorn and get seated!!"
1.0,wall_e,"Another memorable Disney-Pixar gem. A simple and well made science fiction movie that kids and adults will enjoy, along with the important message of caring for the environment, the earth, our home."
1.0,wall_e,"Tell me a movie that in the first 30 mins., that has no dialog but conveys so much within that time frame with that kind of CGI beauty?"
0.0,wall_e,Movie is borning and lame
1.0,wall_e,"In addition to its undeniable sweetness, there is ecological commentary embedded in Wall-E that succeeds without preaching at its audience."

1.0,wall_e,"Had been looking forward to this film since I saw the first trailer and was not disappointed. Once again, Pixar delivers a great love story between two endearing characters and also (though unintentionally) delivers an environmental message of what we humans are doing to our home."
1.0,wall_e,Really good n funny movie
1.0,wall_e,I cried at the brilliant emotion portrayed in this superb romance from Pixar.
1.0,wall_e,The perfect animated movie
1.0,wall_e,Another great example of what Disneys Pixar has to offer. A very moving movie even though there was no dialog. Its almost as if I could feel what Wall-E was feeling.
1.0,wall_e,The primary use of body language in this film makes it unique. The ptomaine displays it's boldness in a good light.
1.0,wall_e,"Arguably Pixar's masterpiece and inarguably one of the greatest films in cinema history, ""WALL-E"" is supremely intelligent, touching, and nostalgic, with characters and themes more poignant than most live-action pictures could only dream of possessing."
1.0,wall_e,This movie is wonderful.
1.0,wall_e,"It's very hard to pick a favorite Pixar Movie, but for me Wall-e comes very very close. The way the story is told makes you care so much for the main character's journey, which combined with mind Blowing visuals and sounds, results in a Amazing Movie! Thanks again Pixar"
1.0,wall_e,This has got to be one of the greatest movies I have ever seen in my entire life.
1.0,wall_e,"Wall-E is a maturely conceived production that largely succeeds emotionally, visually, and intelligently."
1.0,wall_e,"One of Pixar's greatest achievments thus far, and one of the most original and inspiring (though political/social undertones not subtle) animated films of all times. Simplistic, and simply a masterpiece."

1.0,wall_e,"Convertido en un cl¨¢sico de Pixar gracias a su emotividad fuerte, escenograf¨ªa e im¨¢genes bell¨ªsimas y potentes, y una premisa simplemente perfecta. Es toda una oda al g¨¦nero de la animaci¨®n y de la misma manera, a la humanidad."

1.0,wall_e,I love it great childrens movie
1.0,wall_e,"A love story of robots Wall-E and Eve attempting to save Earth over a plant, how simple for Pixar to make another grand slam. Also has a cool message in which you must not rely entirely on robotics to prolong your human life. It'll make you fat."

1.0,wall_e,Just a perfect movie
1.0,wall_e,Probably my most favorite animation film ever. I was a sucker for a lonely humble robot doing his job and seeking love. A kind-hearted film with its necessary humor. I loved it. The action and storyline were wonderful. Great film.

1.0,wall_e,this movie was everything i expected it to be and more. really adorable!! who knew a cock roach could be so cute!
1.0,wall_e,"This just prooves that the Pixar folks are supreme storytellers. You would expect the visual greatness, but that takes a backseat to the characters. While later viewings may make me wish for a bit less commentary, and more of Wall-E exploring Earth... this movie is just plain great."
1.0,wall_e,"Amazing how they can tell such an amazing robot love story without saying a word. Beautiful visuals and heartwarming story., just the thing we expect from a Disney Pixar."
1.0,wall_e,Another Favorite... Our family watches this one yearly @ least!
1.0,wall_e,By far the best pixar film of all time !!
1.0,wall_e,"Where do I begin? Lovely, charming, stellar images. Forget it being one of the best Pixar films, it's one of the best Sci-Fi films period. WALL-E and Eve have great chemistry together, and the way it looks is just breathtaking. And wait, it's a movie promoting environmentalism that's....SUBTLE???"
1.0,wall_e,Can't saw nothing bad about this movie. Everything was excellent!! PIXAR does it again! A Classic!! An animated 2001.
1.0,wall_e,Freaking phenomenal. The sound design is truly the highlight of Wall-E and of course it's full of beautiful animation. How did Andrew Stanton go from this to John Carter?

1.0,1001577-badlands,"Malick's Badlands, while not 100% true to his later-developed style, is still a cerebral character analysis of the minds of two people in love who have lost their innocence but ultimately fail due to their youthfulness."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Perfectly combining two characters of either sadistic, egocentric, or emotionally distant personalities, Badlands blends together a tight execution with a glorious poetic delivery."
0.0,1001577-badlands,"I can't believe the high ratings by some peopleI have seen hundreds of top movies of all kindsThis is one mindless, horrible script of a movieThe violence makes no sense AndHow did Martin Sheen become the greatest shot in the world?Does anyone else care about that?Complete waste of time!!"
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Fresh out of the gate, Terrence Malik wrote and directed this unmatchable star-crossed expressionistic romance."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Simply one of the richest, most intriguing films in the American cinematic canon."
1.0,1001577-badlands,What a gem! Stumbled across this film last night and couldn't stop watching. Def. a must see.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"A very American debut from Malick, repressed, gorgeous, and quietly philosophical."
1.0,1001577-badlands,Sheen and Spacek were unknown at the time and this was Malick's debut so it was overlooked. They're finally catching on.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"It has quickly become one of my favorite movies of all time. Brilliant performances, steady directing, beautiful cinematography and a great score. Surprisingly funny thanks in large part to Martin Sheen's droll wit in the part of the sociopath Kit."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"A young Midwestern couple go on a senseless killing spree. A hauntingly poetic debut rife with violence, love, & beauty."
1.0,1001577-badlands,The brilliant debut of Terence Malick is measured like a beautiful poem and chock full of sumptuous visuals. 'Badlands' is an impressionistic dream of a film.
1.0,1001577-badlands,A film about nihilism. A film about hate and love.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Incredible. Great story told in unbelievable fashion.
1.0,1001577-badlands,This movie was beautiful in every aspect; a visual poem of the death of freedom.
1.0,1001577-badlands,The ending sums up everything.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Wow. Finally saw this and understand the fuss about Terrence Malik - and Martin Sheen as well. Masterful.

1.0,1001577-badlands,"I basically love all things Malick. This isn't my favorite amongst his movies, but it' still pretty spectacular."
1.0,1001577-badlands,One of my all time favorites.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Obra m¨¢xima de Malick, onde tudo funciona e tem em seu elenco sua maior for?a."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Fantastic. It is a dreamlike tale of murder, blind love, and the desire to escape. Malick is a truly masterful filmmaker."
0.0,1001577-badlands,"This turns an ugly spate of serial killings into a rhinestone cowboy, ready the real story to see how ugly the murders were... joke.."
1.0,1001577-badlands,So disturbing yet beautiful at the same time. A true American masterpiece.
1.0,1001577-badlands,So Spare & Poetic it chills you to the bone
1.0,1001577-badlands,Terrence Malick's best film. Cinematographic masterpiece of a cowboy brand James Dean running from the law with a girl far too young for any good. Loved it
1.0,1001577-badlands,"The greatest debut film since Citizen Kane. Malick transcends the genres this film milks to create a statement about America that few dared to enunciate. The emptiness of the landscapes, the self-lies and movie-derived self-images haunt the viewer."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Badlands is really that good; beautifully constructed, impeccably script, but for the film buffs, it is the perfect film about a serial killer on the run for the American Dream."
1.0,1001577-badlands,A masterpiece with unique moments of transcendence and horrifying beauty as well as an excellent Martin Sheen and a perfect and natural Sissy Spacek who enlightens the screen with her vibrant honesty.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Terrance Malick's AUDACIOUS debut!! Film as art!
1.0,1001577-badlands,"A beautifully shot tale of murder, angst, individualism and a white t shirt that just never gets dirty no matter what is thrown at it."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Excellent Bonnie and Clyde style movie by Terrence Malik. I'm yet to see a stinker by this guy. Fabulous vacuous and wastelandish scenery. As the death tolls keep on mountain, so does the gripping tension. Martin Sheen was fantastic as the cool laid back Kit"
1.0,1001577-badlands,A strangely poignant and hypnotic film.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Few filmmakers can carve their own cult and call it art in Hollywood. Terrence Malick is one of those filmmakers.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Badlands is Moonrise Kingdom with bloodshed not strictly limited to dogs.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"What an incredible debut from Malick. Still as fresh and beautiful today, especially in the gorgeous new criterion transfer. This is his best film, a masterpiece on all levels."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Malick's first film venture is my personal favorite, because its the least Malicky one of the lot. This is because a narrative is present, and he actually cares about the performances here. A delightful little crime saga of two teenagers on the run from the law."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Remarkable debut - Malick sprang forth fully formed, like Venus from the sea. His trademarks are in place: gorgeous, naturally lit cinematography and day-to-day actions set against vast landscapes. This is finally being released on Blu-ray by Criterion!"
1.0,1001577-badlands,"When pared down a bit, Badlands can be described as a road movie. Since the main characters and where they go are the most important aspects of most such films, and Malick's lead actors both give great performances, Badlands works on many levels."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Malick's first movie may not be as challenging or arresting as some of his later work, but Badlands still gave me a taste of pure cinematic poetry."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Malick's debut is still one of the greatest films in existence, there's really nothing more I can say about it without writing pages upon pages of praise. If you haven't seen it, watch it, then watch it again."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Badlands is a stellar work of American filmmaking, packed with the visual beauty and dignified performances that would distinguish the films of director Terrence Malick."
1.0,1001577-badlands,Terrence Malick is one of the greats.
1.0,1001577-badlands,One of Terrence Malick's best :-)
1.0,1001577-badlands,Wow. No other words are needed.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Probabaly my favorite Malick flick
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Malick's vision is superb, from the opening scene to the closing scene it is a work of art and beautifully made. Spacek and Sheen's partnership is amazing and the film is amazing from start to finish"
1.0,1001577-badlands,"This insight into the surreal world of a psychopathic killer & his ""simple-minded"" teenage girlfriend is IMHO one of the finest films I've ever seen.It is, compelling, poetic, beautiful, haunting yet eerily unsettling on many levels.An extraordinary film."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Brilliant film, another piece of evidence that the best movies were made in the 70s"
1.0,1001577-badlands,"The most complete movie, never that and never more."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Perhaps one of the best films ever made. Its wonderfully acted and beautifully photographed but its Malick's cooly detached direction that brings all the pieces together and makes it powerful and unforgettable,"

1.0,1001577-badlands,Bizarre and insightful.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"this is a perfect movie, great usage of sound, among everything else in this movie that is f*#@!ing incredible. if you dont like this movie, you need to put your cell phone down & watch it again."
1.0,1001577-badlands,I've been wanting to see this for years and finally got around to it. As beautiful a film about a serial killer and his underage girlfriend on a road trip as you'll ever see.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"It's aimless, directionless, remorseless nature not only serves as wonderful style, but real thoughtfulness."
1.0,1001577-badlands,This may be the strongest debut feature I've seen since CITIZEN KANE. It's perfect.
1.0,1001577-badlands,A fantastic film! Malick's debut is one of the best films of the seventies and gave us a glimpse at his future film making!
1.0,1001577-badlands,this movie was terrfic even though i just got done watching it i think that this is one of the amazing films i have ever seen so far it is my 2nd fav malick film but it amazing the netire way though martin sheen was amazing and overall this is a terrence malick masterpecie!!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Another masterpiece from the best decade for American cinema featuring amazing performances (Sissy Spacek, I'll always have a soft spot for you)."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Poetic, obscure and very watchable. The violence is brazen, very much like it would be in life, and much of the photography is unexpected. Sheen and Spacek are remarkably likable; Malick's debut comes across as the Mean Streets of the midwest, but softer."
0.0,1001577-badlands,Terrible. Nonsensical. Pretty scenery but not good.

1.0,1001577-badlands,One of the weirdest movie I've ever seen. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing! A work of art.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Great on so many levels! Terrence Malick is a force to be reckoned with.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Na fala??o de Malick para Cannes, resolvi assistir a obra do autor, do in¨ªcio; filme muito bom; em todos os aspectos;"
1.0,1001577-badlands,An interesting based on true story. Martin and Sissy rule.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Eminently watchable. Martin Sheen has a magnetic screen presence and at only 90 minutes the film is just perfect. It's also a hell of a good looking film but that goes without saying for a Terrence Malick picture.Fantastic.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"One of the most bizarre films I've ever seen, with a tone that not only has never been reproduced ever, but is almost unexplainable. There is an eerieness to the cluelessness of the two protagonists that is completely strange but totally fascinating at the same time."
1.0,1001577-badlands,Flixter users are stupid.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"An awesome movie, with beautiful cinematography, great directing, writing and acting!"

1.0,1001577-badlands,This is the first Sheen film i've seen but i'd go as far to say that this is likely his best role to date. Badlands is a real-life inspired film about a trigger-happy Sheen which is a very original take on the norm of serial killer features.

1.0,1001577-badlands,"Malick is my favourite director, and this was his first film, and one of the best debuts by a director, I think. Classic American angst story of a young couple fleeing the law and the American society in the fifties midwest."

1.0,1001577-badlands,"Best use of voice over in a film, ever."
1.0,1001577-badlands,I hope my debut can come as close to artful poetry as this film. The frames are so wide and the writing is so wonderful that this movie pushes into the realm of literature.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"What will it take to start seeing American cinema like this again? This travel narrative tears apart the fairy tale of the home, romance, and nature. Flawless!"
1.0,1001577-badlands,A quietly beautiful film. Malick's approach to following Kit and Holly without judgement is relaxing for me in an off-putting way.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"In terms of its cinematic beauty, the script's ability to maneuver through the adept usage of humor, action, romance, and suspense, it's everything that Bonnie & Clyde wished it could be, and then some."

1.0,1001577-badlands,Terrence Malick pulls something so new out of a story so old. You'll have to see it to make your own decisions but there is something so beautiful in the innocence of these two characters on screen that even when they do horrible things you can't help but smile.

1.0,1001577-badlands,"An amazing cinematic experience. Martin Sheen is great in this career defining role that pegs him as the 70s James Dean, and Sissy Spacek is even better as his naive girlfriend. Probably the most interesting couple-crime movie since Bonnie and Clyde."

1.0,1001577-badlands,"The unique, lilting music would subsequently crop up in True Romance, though Tarantino???s generation has yet to dethrone Badlands as the most haunting of all couple-on-the-run movies."

1.0,1001577-badlands,"El director Terrence Malick solo ha hecho 4 cintas y todas son espectaculares... Escojo a ""Badlands"" por ser la mas oscura de las 4 y porque deja en la verguenza a ""Natural Born Killers""."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"I can't fault this film on any level.From the story, based on fact, (Charles Starkweather),acting,costume,music.etc Terrence Malick is a brilliant director."

1.0,1001577-badlands,Martin Sheen's best role...that I've seen (including Apocalypse Now).My only criticism: there were a few moments where the music was kind of cheesy. I think it must have been the James Taylor contributions: generic 70's.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Seriously, the most imitated film in cinematic history. I still love it though."
1.0,1001577-badlands,Gorgeous yet unsettling.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Beautifully directed, subtle acting, and STUNNING cinematography. An emotionally gripping take on the Charles Starkweather-Caril Ann Fugate killings. This is what ""Natural Born Killers"" tried to do, but FAILED."
1.0,1001577-badlands,Terrence Malick is a visual poet.
1.0,1001577-badlands,A film of cinematic poetry.
1.0,1001577-badlands,amazing film! sissy is the best!
1.0,1001577-badlands,malick appears on the scene fully formed in style. at 90~ minutes much tighter in pacing than his more recent movies which maybe heightens the juxtaposition of ambiguous visuals and revealing narration.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Still one of the greatest American films of all time.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Sheen's ""Kit"" is as much a ""walking contradiction"" as Deniro's later ""Travis Bickle"" would be, and both films are far funnier than they get credit for."

1.0,1001577-badlands,"This film is horrifying, haunting, and indescribable. If I taught film, this would be a must see. I feel like I understand a little more about everything. There are no answers in this film, just various and subtle truths about its characters."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Terrance Mallick's Empty, Yet Beautifal 'Badlands'. Fantastic."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Rich and full of deep, astounding images (as always with Malick) that will burn in your mind, and leave you haunted with dark, unanswerable questions."
1.0,1001577-badlands,The essential tragic American Romance. Voice over is very effective. Cinematography is breathtaking. Captures something quintessentially American.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"The pace is slow, which can seems strange at first for a movie about a couple running away, but it totally fits and the outstanding cinematography add a desolation atmosphere to the pessimistic storyline."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"A daring masterpiece of cinema, an update of Rebel Without a Cause for the next generation of lost souls who felt out of touch with the world."

1.0,1001577-badlands,Terence Malick's debut is a beautifully-shot examination of two lovers who roam the American prairie as Sheen quietly (and politely) kills people.

1.0,1001577-badlands,"""I wish they make a Special edition DVD of this one day. One of the best movies ever made, a ladmark achivement for Terrence Malick, and a star-making performance by Martin Sheen"""
1.0,1001577-badlands,This film is beautiful.

1.0,1001577-badlands,"Terrence Malick's debut pictures the fragility of innocence, thin line between good and evil and the haphazard nature of life. The light, the settings, the rythm and the actors are great."
1.0,1001577-badlands,This is my favorite film of all time. In my opinion its Martin Sheen at his best and Sissy Spacek is brilliant too. Its a great film!
1.0,1001577-badlands,greaaatttttttt really beautiful shots
1.0,1001577-badlands,Ooit op een nacht op televisie gezien. Terrence Malick is een echte kunstenaar. Ofwel ben je helemaal voor ofwel helemaal tegen dit soort film. Buitenaards mooie sfeer.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Just beautiful, loved the burning house shoot"
1.0,1001577-badlands,A master piece that has been homaged over and over. A pure work of genius. The cinematography serves to compliment the sublime understated performances of Martin Sheen and Sissey Spacek.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Who said that Sissy Spacek wasn't ever sexy and that treehouses weren't for adults? Martin Sheen's best performance.

1.0,1001577-badlands,Leccion de como hacer una buena pelicula
1.0,1001577-badlands,"A Terrence Mallick tour de force. Martin Sheen as a James Dean imitator, Sissy Spacek another quitessentially strange sociopathic teen and of course the only cameo of the director you'll ever see. A dark journey into the dark heart of America with a killing spree leading into the badlands."
1.0,1001577-badlands,One of the best American heartland films ever!!!!!!!
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Regardless of whether you're male, female, or hermaphrodite, gay, straight, or bi, you'll fantasize about *licking off every last one of Sissy Spacek's freckles.*If you're into BDSM, please read biting in place of licking."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Gorgeous, bleak American landscapes, wonderfully photographed, provide the perfect backdrop for this tale of American morality and amorality. Sissy Spacek's vacant detachment is a perfect foil for Martin Sheen's doomed implosive rage. Best watched on a big screen, but will never disappoint."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"performances in this film are just so good, and the music makes it just wonderful to watch"
1.0,1001577-badlands,a young Martin Sheen shows that Charlie looks like a cloan of his Dad. Sissy does a great job as a naive kid who ends up on a dangerous path. Martin Sheen was and is a great lead actor. He commands your attention.
1.0,1001577-badlands,This is the movie that i watch over and over.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Aimless kids in love end up going on a murder and robbery spree in the 50s. Great performances by Sheen and Spacek on a very styled and atmospheric direction by Terrence Malick. A classic.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Terrence Malick has in his career to date only made three films. In over thirty years. However every one is worth watching and there aren't many directors you can say that about. Badlands is sublime.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Malick's first, and still most powerful (even though the image perfection would only be reached in Days of heaven). Fantastic Martin Sheen & Sissy Spacek."

1.0,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,"The weakest of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy is still one of the best movies ever made.

1.0,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,Greatest series to date!
0.0,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,"Long, drawn out, mostly boring. Here's the story - a lot of death, a lot of waiting for death and a lot of dying. The only enjoyment was making fun of the names froyo dumbledor, doppy. I should have just turned it off."
1.0,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,"Again, too good to be true"
1.0,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,The second part to the trilogy.

1.0,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,"It is often said that this book is the unimportant, boring, and unnecessary middle ground, which I have always disagreed with. Peter Jackson saw the beauty of this book like I did and made it even more. And the Helms Deep battle has changed battle scenes for the entire future of movie history."
1.0,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,"Carrying one of the best fantasy battles of all time, and showing despair, triumph, and the rewards of friendship, this trilogy is gaining powerful speed."

1.0,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,The least of the three movies(I can't in good conscience call it the worst) but it's still a freakin great movie. Helms Deep is awesome. The march of the Ents is cool. And Gollum is amazing.
1.0,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,"Another three hours that went by in a whiff. Again I'm astonished as to how well this fits in with the way I had envisioned this tale visually. Now for the third instalment, and then maybe the extended versions just for hood measure..."

1.0,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,Should have won the Oscar
1.0,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,"The much darker second installment of the epic motion picture trilogy. Two Towers ticks all the criteria for an excellent sequel: with a host of new and interesting characters, stunning new locations and cultures and some awesomely orgasmic battle scenes as well."
1.0,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,Watching the extended version...I love the whole series
1.0,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,Tolkien is the king of fantasy and Peter Jackson did right by him.

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,One incredibly fun and unforgettable adventure.
1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"This Movie Was Also One Of Humphrey Bogart's Great Roles . This Film Was A Great One Because It Blended Romance, Drama, Adventure And Action ."

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,An amazing adventure film with awesome performances from Katherine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart who display real chemistry throughout the film.
1.0,the_african_queen_1951,Wonderful film. I have seen it twice and look forward to watching it again. The sweet way that Charlie falls for Rose is something that only two wonderful actors can portray. The scene where Bogart imitates the hippos and makes her laugh is adorable. The wedding is unforgettable.
1.0,the_african_queen_1951,Fantastic in every meaning of the word.
1.0,the_african_queen_1951,Entertaning and thououghly entrancing. Bogart is absolutely superb. A film classic
1.0,the_african_queen_1951,A strange film with a compelling story and exemplary acting.
1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"The scenes of Hepburn and Bogart was marvelous and lovely. I was so entertained by them. The only thing I was bothered was the special effects. However, it is an excuse since they are not that advanced then as we are now."

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,I love this movie! It's a Hepburn-Bogart classic and since the 2 number 1 screen legends of the American Film Institute (AFI) this is my second favorite Bogie movie of all time my favorite is Casablanca!!! ?~
1.0,the_african_queen_1951,Wonderful movie! I love Humprey Bogart!
1.0,the_african_queen_1951,I was watching this movie and love it.
1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"John Huston filmed his World War I epic on location, which was an unusual decision at the time, but the grittiness and festering of the jungle perfectly matches the griminess of our main characters, played by Bogart and Hepburn."
1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"A classic, its smart, funny and sweet all at the same time."

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,Great on screen chemistry along with a good story make even the obvious effects from the '50s not seem so important.
1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"The 1951 classic that won Humphrey Bogart an Oscar and inspired the Jungle Cruise at Disneyland was every bit as awesome as I had pictured it. The special effects are definitely of their time, but that doesn't stop it from being a timeless film."
1.0,the_african_queen_1951,The first of a series of boy meets girl and they take on the world. Once again a classic movie with two of the greatest actors to ever live. Joe versus the Volcano might be said to be a take off of AQ. Very loosely. Same struggles different picture.

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"When you have two of the silver screen's biggest icons (if not the biggest), in a movie with a sound script and great director, the result is a marvelous picture with plenty of romance, comedy, and thrills. That and two great performances by Bogart and Hepburn."
1.0,the_african_queen_1951,Bogart and Hepburn an awesome classic....
1.0,the_african_queen_1951,You might think that this boat isn't big enough for the two of them but they eventually make the room needed & it yields classically rewarding results.

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"The relationship between Bogey and Hepburn is marvelous, as they first despise each other and then long for one another. Charlie Alnut is one of cinema's best characters, often overshadowed by Bogey's own Fred C. Dobbs. A trek well-worth the taking."
1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"There are a couple stars in each generation that steal our hearts so completely we'll watch anything they're in. Bogey and Kate are both such stars, and to see them together in a well-made (John Huston) film is a delight worth savoring again and again."

1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,The classic Robin Hood tale features the brilliant exuberance and swagger of Errol Flynn. This is Hollywood at its finest. The hero is truly heroic and the villains are evil. Sometimes the simplest stories are the best.

1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"The movie that made Errol Flynn a big star, in the role he was born to play. Olivia DeHavilland is Maid Marion, with Claude Rains and Basil Rathbone. Pure entertainment in a story often told but never done as well as this."

1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"Re: Michael Richards comment regarding Olivia de Havilland's regard for Errol Flynn. It was Bette Davis, not Olivia, who detested Flynn.

1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"One of the bets movies ever. The technicolor was awesome (especially for a movie that is this old), and the movie had one of the best sword fighting ever"
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,oh I love it!!! I used to watch this as a child and imho it has not lost its magic yet. Flynn is the greatest Robin Hood of all time :-)
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,Flynn at his finest!
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,a must see and must have
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,Errol Flynn...'Nuff said....
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"Light, breezy fun and the best film out there on this legendary hero. The over-saturated Technicolor is beautiful to look at. The music is terrific, too, and informed John Williams Star Wars score."
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,Errol Flynn is the definitive screen Robin Hood.
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"""Ohhh Errol, I would give anything, just to be like him..."" (Aussie Crawl - sometime in the 80s)Kevin Costner as ROBIN HOOD?!?! U've gotta be kidding me.This much earlier version (1938) isLEGEN...(wait for it)...DARY!"
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"The definitive Robin Hood movie. Glorious technicolor photography, terrific fight scenes (even for now), a dashing Errol Flynn and a worthy opponent in Basil Rathbone. All topped up with an incredible and legendary Korngold score."
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,THE action/adventure film that set the standard for all that followed.
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"Not great drama, but a lot of fun, and highly worth seeing many times"
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,This is how action-adventure should be. The swordfight between Flynn and Rathbone is still one of the best in cinema history.
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"Un sc??nario magnifique, un d??cor en carton, tout un imaginaire marqu?? par ce film, un chef d'??uvre de cin??ma bourr?? de faux raccords et de nuit am??ricaine, bref de gros trucages comme on aime. Vive le cin??ma qui fait r??ver sans avoir l'exigence du r??alisme."
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,Still the best silver screen telling of the Robin Hood story of all time. Flynn and de Havilland are perfect together.
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"Errol Flynn at his swashbuckling best? Well yes, because this and Captain Blood are the finest swashbuckling movies ever filmed."
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"Oh, the glory of technicolor. I have a hard time dealing with the fact that this was made 70 years ago, the action is so good."
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,A classic and a must to see.
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,one of the best robin hood films love the deuling shadows!
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"A true classic,gotta love Technicoloor.............gotta love Errol Flynn"
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"welcome to Sherwood Forest, m'lady"
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,omg.. I am the hugest fan of Errol Flynn! I wish he had been in Gone with the Wind as well!
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,Who wouldn't love this film. Flynn's best by a mile! One of the many he did with DeHavilland. They lit up the screen. Delightful!
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,this is my favorite movie of all time
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"A classic film from the Golden Age of cinema. Great story, swashbuckiling action, boo hiss baddies and beautiful maidens (I have a thing for Olivia de Havilland) make this a hugely enjoyable film. It just makes you want to run around with a sword and laughing heartily at your enemies. Or something."
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"I just love this move, it's a classic. Not sure about the green tights though hahaha."
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"The standard by which all other Robin Hoods are judged, and I defy you to find a later film that doesn't copy from this one in some way. Glorious!"
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"A Golden Age romp on the Warners back lot, gorgeous Technicolor, Rathbone, de Havilland and Flynn at his charismatic best. Simply scrumptious."
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,THE BEST ROBIN HOOD MOVIE EVER!!!!
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,Kevin Costner as Robin Hood??? LMAO . This is a swashbuckler unlike all others. The costumes are dated but so what? These are grown men acting like little boys and reveling in the sheer pleasure of it. Perhaps the greatest of all the Robin Hood films..
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"Pure spun corny gold is served up in huge doses in this truly great film. After seventy years it still works on almost all levels, and the fight scenes are stunt magic to behold. Errol Flynn's best film really does capture his best work. The best Robin Hood film period."
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,vraiment le meilleur sur le sujet
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,now who doesn't love robin hood it's my all time favorite it doesn't matter if it's this one or a spin off like men in tights i like them all
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,Swash swash buckle buckle!
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"Fun, exciting, and cheerful. You cant help but smile throughout the entire duration of the film. This personifies the great Errol Flynn's talents as the highlight of his career."
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,This gets better (and so much funnier - see the Merry Men dancing in circles whilst Robin throws clothes to the crowds!) with time. A favourite
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,Perhaps the greatest adventure movie of all time.
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,[color=black]Errol Flynn Rocks. No star today would look nearly as good in green tights as he did![/color]
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,I love this movie for purely nostalgic reasons. I saw it when I was about 5 years old and fell in love :0)
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,the best version of Robin Hood
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,This is easily the best Robin Hood film ever. Errol Flynn IS Robin Hood. Awesome film even 60-plus years later.

1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"This is the definitive fairy tale Robin Hood. Highly romanticized and filled with adventure, this is also one of the most beautiful ""Technicolor"" films ever to be put on the screen. It's a well made, well acted, and incredibly fun adventure."
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,I love Robin Hood. He is just wonderful!
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,Great movie. Anyone who doesn't think Flynn was a good actor should watch this movie. It takes a good actor to say some of these corny lines and have the character still be a believable swashbuckler. Great job.
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"This is as about as wholesome, fun-filled, swashbuckling classic as you're going to get."
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,I have always loved this movie. omg was Errol Flynn a hottie even though he was a lush
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,a definate classic and must see.
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,It embodies the quitessence of any adventure movie. Best movie about Robin hood of course (dont even try to compare). maybe the best Curtiz-Flynn?
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,Rousing swashbuckler with the great Errol Flynn.
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,I used to watch this in the video store on a regular basis. Along with Sinbad.

1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,The best man I've ever seen in tights. Errol Flynn is so gorgeous playing the role of Robin. Olivia ia beautiful as well. The best movie they did together.

1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"One of the most swashbucklingest adventures you'll ever experience. Flynn is the ultimate Robin Hood, and Rathbone is the classies nemesis any hero could ask for. On that note, the duel between Hood and Rathbone's Sir Guy is legendary."

1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"So much fun! Errol Flynn is the best Robin Hood ever and Olivia DeHavilland is smokin as Maid Marion. Plus Claude Rains! ""Give Me Back my Mutton Joint!"" And sword fighting! Nothing better."

1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"Definitely in my top 5. Absolutley lovable characters, Errol Flynn as Robin Hood is attractive enough to turn any man gay (I am by no means gay). Friar Tuck is hilarious, and that evil old Prince John is just as wicked as you would expect. Off with his head!"

1.0,hero,One of my favorite Jet Li movies. Watching it now for the eighth time and it's magnificent every time. Quentin Tarantino is a genius director. The imagery and story line are like no other.

1.0,hero,Hands-down best movie I have ever seen.

1.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,"""Rencontre du troisi¨¨me type"""
1.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,What can one say that hasn't been said already? A Sci-Fi classic.
1.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,"Without this film, i have no idea where Sci-fi movies would have ended. This intelligent story gives us a revolution in film-making. Not only is the story great, but the acting is excellent as well. Close Encounters of the Third Kind is Spielberg's gift to the world."
1.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,"The way Spielberg handles the topic of UFOs is fascinating. The phenomenon is at the same time fantastical but also grounded in reality. However the most terrestrial ingredients, like the resonance of the characters and their relationships, are what makes this film perfect."
1.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,my favorite steven spielberg movie
1.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,I...FUCKING LOVE THIS MOVIE
1.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,Like The Day The Earth Stood Still a film of hope when aliens contact Earth.
1.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,"Pure speilbergian magic, awe inspiring, magnificent, wonderous, scary, emotional and beautiful, with some of the greatest, most iconic music in film, and special effects that still, even 34 years later, look perfect, one of the greatest films ever made. It still gives me chills like few other films."
1.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,"When I watched this movie I was not so critical of cinema as I am now, but every time I remember an image or a sound of this movie, I feel once more the wonder and suspense that I had at the moment...it has no comparison..."
1.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,What a spectacle. The finale is one of the best to be committed to film.
1.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,Possibly my favorite film about aliens. Spielberg's best science-fiction movie.

0.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,No one tells you it's boring as hell.
1.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,Just watched this again recently and I forgot how wonderful it is. Watch it again or for the first time-it is worth the time.
1.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,"i thought that this was an excellent movie. even though it was bizarre, it had an excellent plot, it always kept you wondering through the whole movie, and this movie was way far ahead of its time"
1.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,It is Very surreal. Spielberg is the ultimate craftsman!!!
1.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,A masterpiece by Spielberg. You will be very impressed by the final scenes.
1.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,"One of the most beautiful and stunning sci-fi films I have ever seen. This is all thanks to Richard Dreyfuss's mind-blowing performance and Spielberg's intelligent direction. The writing, the premise, basically everything in total is why this is one of the best films I have ever seen. See it now!"
1.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,Greatest sci-fi movie ever made
0.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,So slow and doesn't make too much sense.
1.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,"Tan, Nan, Nam, Non, Na."
1.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,"Another revisit of a favorite. Great, but flawed, film. Some of Dreyfuss's breakdown plays too broadly. Blu-ray really shows the flaws in the 70's era anamorphic optics and high-speed film stock."
1.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,Graphically stunning and phsycologically thrilling. One of Spielberg's best.
1.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,"This movie is hard to explain, but it does fall into the ""film epic"" category. It's a very long, very slow, very intriguing look into a man who becomes obsessed with aliens - who aren't necessarily as bad as we make them out to be."
1.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,Not an ounce of pure magic has faded from this film over thirty years later. A deserved masterpiece and possibly the best movie yet made involving our friends from the heavens.
1.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,I think this is one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever made. It has a GREAT story. I've loved it since I was little. (I'm sad my husband thought it was boring!)
1.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,caught this movie on tv the other night at Matt's -- always a good time!
1.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,They just don't make them like this anymore. Spielberg's signature sense of wonderment has perhaps never been so prevalent in any of his movies as it is in Close Encounters. Five musical chords have never packed so much punch
1.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,Still love watchin it!!
0.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,"fell asleep within the first 20 minutes, tried to watch it again, same thing happened"
0.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,"boring and sluggishly paced. cold and sterile, though professionally directed and produced. i watched the new remastered edition in 1080p. at least they are not ashamed of their 1970s era special effects like star wars."
0.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,"How Speilberg won acclaim for this piss poor film I'll never know, its a joke.I like Sci-fi but this is pathetic."
1.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,I've seen this movie so many times I'm now sick of it; but I give it five stars for old times' sake.

1.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,"The original cut of the film was excellent, though it's the director's cut which I find warrants essential viewing."
1.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,"Outstanding movie that unfortunately isn't put on the same ""masterpiece"" level that some of Spielberg's other films. Great movie that suceeds the most as a story about a man on a mission to find answers. John Williams does a great job creating the score.  See before you die."
1.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,"I saw this when it first came out in the theaters back in '78. I feel the same way today as I did then, with my sense of wonder still caught up in the film. Too bad they don't make them like this today..."

1.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,"There's nothing to say, watch it for yourself and see how majestic and awe inspiring it really is. Steven Spielberg has reset the bar very very high when it comes to putting aliens in movies."

1.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,"Francamente la mejor pelicula de encuentros alienijenas de todos los tiempos. Un clasico que nunca sera olvidada, y un gran impacto en el '77, cuando los avistamientos de seres extraterrestres eran muy comunes."
