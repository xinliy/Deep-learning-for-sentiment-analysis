0.0,snatched_2017,As a brain surgeon I am seriously concerned about those that found anything that remotely resembled comedy in this movie. You need to schedule an appointment for a functional MRI brain scan immediately. You have a section of brain matter that is malfunctioning!
1.0,snatched_2017,We loved this movie! Perfect mother daughter flick. Hilarious!! Would see it again!
0.0,snatched_2017,Literally the first comedy I have EVER walked out of. Amy Schumer was funny 3 years ago but every year she has become more and more irrelevant and ridiculous to me. She is SO out of touch with most Americans that she can't make a movie that connects with anyone. Avoid this bomb
1.0,snatched_2017,"Hilarious, mostly in the beginning but the family stuff at the end was good too. Another Schumer must see."
1.0,snatched_2017,"I love Amy's humor (contrary to most people) and I honestly thought this movie was great.

1.0,snatched_2017,"There aren't many movies that make me literally laugh out loud, but this one did, many times! Amy is wrong and raunchy and real and hysterical.

0.0,snatched_2017,Had high hopes for this film but apparently the same old dull rhetoric from Schumer with a lack of imagination doomed this to oblivion. Watch the trailer that's the only funny parts in the movie I would like a refund but I think she needs the money to buy matresses to repair her image.

0.0,snatched_2017,"After all the joke stealing, Amy Schumer is as about enticing as that Denny's with the most health code violations in the area"
0.0,snatched_2017,So very unfunny. Don't spend your money on this one.
0.0,snatched_2017,"This movie isn't funny at all, stay home not worth seeing."
0.0,snatched_2017,An absolute disaster. I am at a complete loss as to why Amy Schumer is an actor. This movie's utter failure should mark the conclusion of her acting career.
0.0,snatched_2017,"Poor Goldie having to be starred with this racist, joke stealing hack. I guess if you enjoy a by the numbers 'buddy comedy' you will get a few laughs. For me it's an insult to truly talented female comedians."
0.0,snatched_2017,Same tired jokes. Everything horrible you would expect from Amy Schumer. All the same jokes from Trainwreck only this is a much worse film. View at your own risk.
0.0,snatched_2017,I love Goldie Hawn but this movie was unwatchable. amy Schumer needs acting lessons or stop acting all together.

1.0,the_artist,Amazing acting & score.
1.0,the_artist,"Even it is a black-and-white silent movie; it is a witty and jolly movie to watch. It has a great story and peculiar visual style. With great performances from Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo, it is surely a masterpiece from Michel Hazanavicius."

1.0,the_artist,"I didn't know what to expect and after watching it I was amazed at what it actually is. it is amazing, heartwarming and infectious. It almost sneaks up on you with its charm. Charm is the perfect word for the direction, the screenplay, and the lead actor. A movie to just sit back and enjoy..."

1.0,the_artist,This was definitely a different experience since I am used to nothing but films with talking. It was wonderful!
1.0,the_artist,"Fantastic. I don't see any other movie that could come close this year.

1.0,the_artist,"Great movie. It was quite inovative for our time (which is funny considering it is essentially a silent film). Great acting, quite comedic but yet with a serious story to it. It did feel quite foreign to the ears though, watching a movie that had no sound to except the music."

1.0,the_artist,I didn't expect that at all. Really good movie.
0.0,the_artist,I didn't like this movie at all. All movies should have sound in them not wait until the very end. You can't feel the emotions of the actors and actresses without hearing them. You have to keep your eye on the screen the WHOLE time and it isn't fun to just watch a movie.
1.0,the_artist,So happy I saw this. Best movie of 2011.
1.0,the_artist,Yeah. It's really that good.
1.0,the_artist,"To give you an idea of how great this movie is, I took my 12 year old daughter to see it, it is Black and White and no dialogues. She asked to see it again and has been recommending it to all her friends. 'Nuff Said."

1.0,the_artist,"The Artist is a genuine rarity of a masterpiece, a french perspective on American silent film, and there is absolutely no shock behind how it won best film of the year during the academy awards of 2012, as it's spirited, charming, and executed with the utmost skill."
1.0,the_artist,"Excelente, brillante, magistral, cautivadora, sorprendente; esa y mil palabras m¨¢s se merece como adjetivo calificativo ""El artista"". Una hermosa obra de arte."
1.0,the_artist,"A great film that shows just how simple it is to tell a great story. I feel like this film is a outcry to studios that you don't need parlor tricks, CGI, and cheesy stories to make something entertaining. Highly recommended and a must-see for any fan of cinema or filmmaking."
1.0,the_artist,Couldn't be better! Their expressions are wonderful! The way to tell the story without speaking is great! You don't even miss it. Super fan of it! Great and awsome film!

1.0,the_artist,"The Artist is a charming and bright movie about the introduction of ""talkies"" into the film industry in the 1920's and follows around two characters.

1.0,the_artist,"The only movie besides The Return of the King to make me have full on sobs of joy. An original, light-hearted movie that explains the change in technology and filmmaking in the 20s. Instead of tugging at heart strings, it basically ripped mine out."

1.0,the_disaster_artist,"Funiest Movie with a lot of heart. About dreams and never give up, like a modern daay Forest Gump, jejeje"
0.0,the_disaster_artist,"It was filmed with that cheap and distracting shaky ""handycam"" style of filmmaking. I felt motion sick after ten minutes and walked out and got a refund. When is Hollywood going to stop filming with this terrible style?"
1.0,the_disaster_artist,This shit good nigga
1.0,the_disaster_artist,After watching both The Room and the Disaster Artist I can definitely say these guys captured the awkwardness and unintentional humor of The Room. There are parts where you don't know whether to laugh or look away in embarrassment. I'd say that's exactly how we were supposed to feel.
1.0,the_disaster_artist,My movie of the year
1.0,the_disaster_artist,Absolutely loved this film. I've seen it three times already.I loved James Franco in this film and thought it was one of his best performances.
1.0,the_disaster_artist,"Better than ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi""!"
1.0,the_disaster_artist,"the movie stands and falls with James Franco. I enjoyed it cause of francos great performance he killed it. More of that. I never watched ""the room""."
0.0,the_disaster_artist,ragnarok is much more funny than this
1.0,the_disaster_artist,"Hilarous, emotional, perfect, funny and entertaining. This is definitely one of the BEST movies i've ever seen."
0.0,the_disaster_artist,Self indulgent crap. James Franco makes a really dull movie. Not funny. Not entertaining. Nothing even remotely memorable. Just bland bland bland.
1.0,the_disaster_artist,"If a lot of people love each other, the world would be a better place to live."
1.0,the_disaster_artist,"James Franco gives the perfect performance. And considering Tommy Wiseau's personality, that is hard to do! We finally get a look behind the making of the most infamous movie of all time. But instead of making fun of it, it actually makes it human and even inspiring."
1.0,the_disaster_artist,"James and Dave Franco are both fabulous. Terrific story. Highly recommend. I did not see The Room prior to seeing this film, and thoroughly enjoyed the story. The script is well-written. It's funny, touching, and unique."
1.0,the_disaster_artist,James Franco is absolutely brilliant as Tommy Wiseau. The depth of this film is amazing once you peel back the initial layer of it being a movie about a book that was written about a man who writes a book and makes a movie out of it. Brilliant.
0.0,the_disaster_artist,"The Franco brothers are good actors, but this was a bad movie based on a bad movie. Don't waste your money."
1.0,the_disaster_artist,"Did not expect to enjoy this movie as much as I did..but wow! Very entertaining and bought ""The Room"" afterwards!"

1.0,the_disaster_artist,Funniest film I've seen this year! My FAV! Go see it!
1.0,the_disaster_artist,"The Room is one of my favorite movies. That being said, I wonder what a person who has no history with ""The Room"" would think of this film."
1.0,the_disaster_artist,"A fitting biopic to one of the best-worst movies to ever be created. The Franco brothers nailed the characters, the setting and the story. If you've seen the Room and whether your liked it or not this movie will give you a new appreciation for the cult classic."
1.0,the_disaster_artist,As much fun as the movie it's about. And that's saying a lot.
0.0,the_disaster_artist,We were hostages like the movie crew. Like watching a bad car accident.

0.0,the_disaster_artist,"This movie was horrible, like a seven-minute SNL skit stretched out to two hours. James Franco can act, but his brother Dave Franco can't. The novelty ran out after about 20 minutes."
0.0,the_disaster_artist,"I'm sure it's partially because I've never seen THE ROOM, but I thought this was a self-indulgent waste of time. Also, Dave Franco could have used a director, since his brother clearly wasn't doing him any favors."
1.0,the_disaster_artist,"I loved, loved, LOVED this movie. First, it made me laugh, hard. Few movies can really do that. Second, it was touching, on a deep level. Basically, this movie is about the power of friendship. The power of friendship and $6 million."
1.0,the_disaster_artist,"I loved this movie!!!! It was a great surprise for me!! It definitely worth your time! Trust me even if you feel odd in the beginning of the movie, it will all make sence in the end!"
1.0,the_disaster_artist,My life is fully complete. I loved this film.
1.0,the_disaster_artist,Hysterical movie that deserves serious awards considerations.

1.0,the_disaster_artist,Easily one of the best movies of the year.
1.0,the_disaster_artist,"Bizarre, but one of the funniest movies in a very long time. It does not rely on bathroom humor or fart jokes t get laughs. Rather, it is brilliantly written and is nonstop laughter"
1.0,the_disaster_artist,"Great acting, great movie. Now I have to see ""The Room""."
0.0,the_disaster_artist,"Kind of overrated, wanted to leave towards the end"

1.0,the_disaster_artist,"Tommy Wiseau is a truly odd human being, and that's the salt that makes the Earth interesting to live on. I know he wants his own planet, but I for one am glad he got stuck on this one. We're laughing because we love the guy!"
1.0,the_disaster_artist,"One of this year's two best movies. The other, ""The Shape of Water."" This is James Franco at his best, maybe even Best Actor Oscar. Not for everyone...those of you who like it, will love it. I do!"

1.0,the_disaster_artist,Brilliant. I rarely laugh out loud in a cinema but with this it happened multiple times. It's painfully cringe and awkward to watch for all the right reasons.
1.0,the_disaster_artist,"Everything about this film is fantastic , it's funny it's sad , it's moving , it's surprising - just go and see it - really"
1.0,the_disaster_artist,Hope James Franco wins an Oscar this

The Disaster Artist surpassed my expectations and makes a worthy contender for this year?s awards season contenders. Highly recommended!"
1.0,the_disaster_artist,"Absolutely hilarious film that hit all the right emotions. I loved the graininess of the film bringing you to that late 90s look which captures the essence of setting of this comedy. Franco brothers did it again, fantastic job."

1.0,the_disaster_artist,I was in tears. Hadn't laugh from a movie like that in forever!!

1.0,the_disaster_artist,A fantastic look at filmmaking through the eyes of an outsider.
1.0,the_disaster_artist,"James Franco gives perhaps a career best performance as the enigmatic Tommy Wiseau. If you are a fan of Wiseau's ""The Room"" like me, than this movie was made for you. If you're not a fan of ""The Room"", well then there's still a lot to love."
0.0,the_disaster_artist,The first 15-20 minutes were tolerable. And the rest of the movie was horrible. I went to a screening for free and I feel like I should be reimbursed for the $3 I spent for my parking.

1.0,submarine-2010,"A superb directorial d? (C)but from Richard Ayoade. I was absolutely engrossed from the beginning. It is beautifully shot, with great moments of humour, introspection and tenderness. All the actors play convincing roles, but I think Yasmin Paige is particularly excellent. Highly recommended."
1.0,submarine-2010,Sort of feels like an unofficial Wes Anderson film...similar so Moonrise Kingdom at parts. Amazing cinematography with a fresh and original script.
1.0,submarine-2010,There is such gorgeous symbolism and melancholy in Oliver's confessional internal monologues and the aqua-tinged scenery filmed with such nuance. Oliver is the water to Jordana's fire. Each word and frame submerges you in life.

0.0,burnt,"Burnt introduces the audience to the world of Michelin chefs and restaurants. Other than the fact that audience might be impressed that the Michelin world exists in reality, the audience is stuck with a story that lacks substance."
0.0,burnt,A waste of time. Even primary school play is more.logical than this
1.0,burnt,Great movie. I don't care for kitchen chef movies. But damn I got real into it. More respect for high end dining
0.0,burnt,Total crap. Watch the original and forego this one.
0.0,burnt,"Good grief. Moronically bereft of interesting characters. Cliched ridden, predictable and unfunny. Watching a toilet flush would be more intriguing and would contain a better developed storyline."
0.0,burnt,"This movie might have been better if I watched the Food Network. Alas I do not. I was pretty much bored from the moment it started. ""Chef"" with Favreau was much better."

1.0,burnt,"No idea why critics give this outstanding movie such low reviews. Seems like they do not know anything about cinematography.

1.0,burnt,"Quite shocked by the rating this movie got, but it's still a nice, entertaining and decent kind of movie for me nonetheless. Especially for people who is interested in Culinary Arts, this movie gives a lot of knowledge for both literal and practice aspects."
1.0,burnt,A compelling performance by Bradley Cooper is overlooked by critics in this underrated cinematic masterpiece.
0.0,burnt,absolutely terrible. Could't finish it.
1.0,burnt,"Adam Jones (Bradley Cooper) demonstrates how an obsession canhelp you obtain your life goals or be the force that causes you to self-destruct. Although the ending was more hollywood than real life, its still an exciting and entertaining movie."
0.0,burnt,"All this movie did for me was make me hungry. One of the most cliche-filled movie of the year, the characters aren't interesting whatsoever, way too many shots of people making food. This is just a long food network cooking show. Disappointing to say the least"

0.0,burnt,Not as good as I wanted it to be
1.0,burnt,Wow. Surprised by the Flixster negativity. Loved it. Bradley Cooper excellent and believable as the self obsessed Star seeking chef. Maybe liked it more as a foodie who has been on the other side of the table; but I thought the characterisations and performances were excellent.

0.0,ted_2,"Ted 2 is not as good as the first one, and that's saying a lot since the first movie wasn't a good comedy movie to start with. It still does have some scenes with comedy while the rest of the movie can bore you, just like the first movie but the story feels much more badly written."

0.0,ted_2,An embarrassment for all concerned. While I really enjoyed the original the sequel is complete garbage and detracts from Seth MacFarlane's otherwise excellent work.
1.0,ted_2,Awesome funny money way better than teh first!
0.0,ted_2,Wow this film tried so hard to recapture the magic from first film. It fell extremely short.

1.0,ted_2,awesome movie as funny as the first one
0.0,ted_2,"Honestly, such a disappointment. We loved the first Ted and were so looking forward to the sequel. The whole movie felt aimless, forced, and rushed. They tried to use the same joke formulas, and fell short to say the least. Mila Kunis was smart to bow out of this one...don't waste your time."
1.0,ted_2,I loved it. I thought it was a little funnier than the 1st
0.0,ted_2,"Aun gust¨¢ndome mucho el trabajo de MacFarlane, esto es un total desprop¨®sito sin gracia. Hasta me ha dolido verla teniendo presente el buen recuerdo de la primera parte."

1.0,american_ultra,I love this movie romance and action
1.0,american_ultra,I loved this movie! I love Jesse Eisenberg and everything he does. I really wish critics who prefer chick-flicks would quit reviewing movies outside their comfort zone. American Ultra was so good that I'm looking forward to the sequel.
0.0,american_ultra,not a laugh to be had and the actors seem to be going through the motions. No one seemed interested in the film they were making so why should I be?
1.0,american_ultra,Puff on a bit and watch. This movie was so much fun!
1.0,american_ultra,It kept my interest. I thought the leads were very good.
1.0,american_ultra,"seriously under-appreciated. suuuuuuuper dark & very bloody, moves fast, questions everything & even what you know might be coming is done in such rapid pacing, you are thrown off. nothing was too outrageous, it was a blast! first movie where I actually appreciated Stewart as an actress."
0.0,american_ultra,"A chaotic mess of mindless of violence, CIA stuff and ""Ultra"" agent .... i want 90 mins of my life back !"
0.0,american_ultra,"One of the worst half-movies I've ever wasted 45 minutes of my life on. Decent premise but completely incredible with a ridiculous script with heavy-handed, over stylized direction."

1.0,american_ultra,I Can Actually Say its cheesy enough that it works i Recommend Seeing it.
1.0,american_ultra,"Very underrated and deserves a thousand times more recognition than it is given. Original ideas, stylings and dialogue give this film the ideal feel for someone in their early twenty-somethings, going about life."
1.0,american_ultra,Seriously? 45%? What were you people expecting when you sat down to watch this?
1.0,american_ultra,cult movie! Undervalue
1.0,american_ultra,"I thought this movie was completely fun to watch, from the actors to the script to the effects-- loved it all. Reviewers are ragging on it, but I get the sneaky suspicion that we are getting just a touch too serious. Let's try to remember how to enjoy a fun, entertaining flick! Two thumbs up! xo js"
1.0,american_ultra,"Completely underrated. A solid, light heated and well performed action piece. Too many ""Holy s*th, that was cool"" moments to be 43%.... Also, love Kristen Stewart's performance as one of the badass females in the film. 10/10"

1.0,american_ultra,Action packed right from the start. Highly recommend.
0.0,american_ultra,It had potential. Good cast and director. Screenplay awful. Dialogue philistine. Plot is completely unrealistic. Don't waste your time.
1.0,american_ultra,"It was great! Even Kristin Stewart was good. Exciting, nail biting action and funny."

0.0,american_ultra,total waste of 2 hours. still not sure what this was about. skip it.
0.0,american_ultra,"Cringeworthy scenes between Eisenberg and Stewart. Just horrible. If you want to regrettably waste some time, watch this film."
0.0,american_ultra,A real stinker - it's like the writers/producers and director weren't sure if they wanted to make an action/thriller or a comedy and failed at both.
1.0,american_ultra,That was fucking awesome
0.0,american_ultra,Couldn't get through this one. Lame attempts at humor and overall just a boring movie.
0.0,american_ultra,It's supposed to be an action comedy and the action consists of a 140lb actor swinging his fist wildly like Star Wars kid with bone crunching sound effects added in. There isn't a single funny moment either. At one point someone gets tossed a grenade...and it's BEEPING.
1.0,american_ultra,"It was different, it was funny, I don't know why it has such a low rating. I felt it had a simiar slapstick as Zombieland. Kristen Stewart is not the best actor when looking at her history, but she fit her role in American Ultra."
0.0,american_ultra,"Plot was goofy, queerbag movie, weird and confusing ending?"
0.0,american_ultra,couldnt sit through the entire movie......it got too boring towards the middle of the movie
0.0,american_ultra,"Cool idea, poorly executed. I suspect I was not alone because 99% of the theatre-goers also looked bored. I'd know as I started counting the number in attendance purely to do something, anything else."

1.0,american_ultra,Another great movie I wasn't expecting!! Saw it with girlfriend and Elijah great movie.
1.0,american_ultra,"Parts of it were excellent, like the performance between the two main actors, which was actually well crafted and very believable. It was the extraneous supporting quarantine of the town that was not executed particularly well. Overall the move was very entertaining. I would pay to see the sequel."
1.0,american_ultra,Odd and wonderful! I highly recommend this film.
1.0,american_ultra,really good and funny
0.0,american_ultra,"Half a star is generous. Don't bother going to this film. Bad acting, bad script"

1.0,american_ultra,"This movie was a good time. It had laughs, action, and kept me entertained throughout the whole movie. Definitely worth watching."
0.0,american_ultra,This movie was so bad that I walked out after about 30 minutes. Kristen Stewart is too hard to watch and Jessee Eisenberg belongs back in The Social Network movie playing a social awkward weirdo vs a sleeper agent.
1.0,american_ultra,"I'm glad that I knew nothing about this movie going in. In a slew of spy movies as of late, this one stands out as lovably as Max Landis's other written genre work. I'm probably going to go see it again."
0.0,american_ultra,walked out. Couldnt watch more than 10 minutes
1.0,american_ultra,I'm sure this movie will not be well received by many but this is sure to be a cult classic. It is silly and completely ridiculous but it's fun and a great way to end the summer. Take your favorite stoner today and they will love you for it! ?~

1.0,american_ultra,"underrated! the action scenes were pretty awesome, Stewart and eisenberg are a perfect match. gonna watch it 3 more times."
0.0,american_ultra,The only thing worse than a dumb movie with dumb writing featuring obnoxious actors/acting is a dumb movie maker who thinks they're smart.
1.0,american_ultra,It is defiantly with watching. So much comic relief and action perfect combo.
0.0,american_ultra,This movie was worse than I thought it would be. Wish they had a negative rating!
0.0,american_ultra,Not much of a comedy. American Ultra was nothing more than an action movie with few funny parts. The trailer just made the movie out to be better than it actually was. My grade: D
1.0,american_ultra,"Another great entertaining movie, but also very violent. But I love it!"
1.0,american_ultra,this movie I think is under advertised... it was good
1.0,american_ultra,"Amazing movie, very cool."

1.0,american_ultra,Enjoyed this movie very much! Would highly recommend!
1.0,american_ultra,"American Ultra is an amazingly great time. An action movie with a heart, in between moments of whizzing bullets we are treated to some very solid exposition and self reflection. Humorous and intelligent and maybe sometimes a little meta this film delivers everything you hope for and more."
0.0,american_ultra,"Bad, that's it, I hope they don't even think about a part 2 cause that would be a shame"
1.0,american_ultra,Awesome! Action from beginning to end. Little gory but all around entertaining.

0.0,american_ultra,"We walked out. Bloody, pointless, vulgar"
1.0,american_ultra,"Endlessly creative and surprising, I truly appreciated what it was about. Way more dramatic and compelling than expected, I loved it. It may not be everyone's cup of tea but it was right up my alley, more than that, it was up my alley through the back door crashing on my couch."
1.0,american_ultra,"Loved it! Don't get why this got poor reviews. This film had it all--witty comedy, romance, creative action and an original story. Great film!"
1.0,american_ultra,is a lot better for my Age I wide open see it!!!

0.0,american_ultra,The worst movie ever. Should have left 10 minutes in.
0.0,american_ultra,"I thought it would be really good due to all who was in it. But, I was very sorry to say I wasted money on it. It was not very good at all.

1.0,american_ultra,"Action, comedy, fun.. All w/ heart & soul! Recommend !"
1.0,american_ultra,I can't remember when was the last time I laughed so hard in a movie. American Ultra is a must see for those that like action and comedy in one movie.
1.0,american_ultra,"Not a big fan of gratuitous violence. However, the performances of the leads, namely Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg more that make up for flaws and plot holes. If you liked them in Adventureland, you'll love them in American Ultra!"
1.0,american_ultra,Brilliant. Loved the Gary Leib tribute to Darren Merinuk. Bee-you-tea-full!
1.0,american_ultra,very well done! worth going to see more than once.
