1.0,harry_potter_and_the_goblet_of_fire,"It is exciting, it is sad, and it is magical. It shows yet again another memorable moments of the Harry Potter series. It goes down a bit darker from The Prisoner of Azkaban, as it's vibe is more spooky and grim. But this Harry Potter has to be in my Top 3, it is that good."
1.0,harry_potter_and_the_goblet_of_fire,An amazing addition to the franchise that has now become a family classic and must see. It involves many of the beloved moments and characters from the movies.

0.0,1196077-cloudy_with_a_chance_of_meatballs,"Little effort is put into Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs; jokes, characters and dialogue are all one-dimensional, and the treatment of the ""nerdy"" leads is inappropriate for a children's movie."

0.0,1196077-cloudy_with_a_chance_of_meatballs,"Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs is unfunny, has poor animation, and is just about as predictable as many animated movies are these days. The 1 hour 21 minutes felt like more than 3 hours. The characters were the worst part; as cliche as the Walmart smiley face."
1.0,1196077-cloudy_with_a_chance_of_meatballs,This movie gives it a 86%! :-) Love it!!

0.0,1196077-cloudy_with_a_chance_of_meatballs,"The begining of the movie was great, it was cute and funny and sooo sweat, but as the movie went on it just got dumber and dumber by the minute! BIG disappointment."

0.0,1196077-cloudy_with_a_chance_of_meatballs,Absurd.. Whacky.. Nonsense.. A food-junky's dream.. None of the scenes made a sense at all. It's just a patience-testing movie!
1.0,1196077-cloudy_with_a_chance_of_meatballs,"This is at the TOP of the Hosanna Wants-to-see-it-List. It seems to be her exact brand of humor. SOOO, Mommy and Daddy are taking her out to eat (spaghetti, of course) and to the opening night as a late Birthday present."
1.0,1196077-cloudy_with_a_chance_of_meatballs,Great for kids of all ages. Funny heart warming and entertaining. I could probably watch this movie again.

1.0,1196077-cloudy_with_a_chance_of_meatballs,This is freaking hilarious.
0.0,1196077-cloudy_with_a_chance_of_meatballs,Why did they make this? I do not like this movie at all! Its forgettable and the only thing it expresses is its originalality. But to me its stupid and really annoying. Just overall overrated and lame.
1.0,1196077-cloudy_with_a_chance_of_meatballs,"It was a really fun and very entertaining animated family movie. It had great animation, visuals, music, lots of laughs, fantastic voice cast, lots of action, great characters and a very interesting storyline. It's one of the best animated films of 2009. It should be fun for both kids and adults."
0.0,1196077-cloudy_with_a_chance_of_meatballs,"'Sokay. Manages to become an extended metaphor for the US's out-of-control food industry and be occasionally witty along the way. Between this and Ratatouille, I prefer this (not high praise, but good enough)."
1.0,1196077-cloudy_with_a_chance_of_meatballs,Saw this by myself. Laughed for 1 hour and 21 minutes straight.

1.0,harry_potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban,Things done differently might not always offer the same quality experience unless if accurately timed with well balanced direction and masterful adaptation which Prisoner Of Azkaban doesn't seem to unduly overload with mixed factors from start to finish.
1.0,harry_potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban,"The best Harry Potter film in my opinion, it's beautifully directed and the actors performance is stellar especially by Watson. The last half hour is full of thrilling sequences and interesting plot twists."

1.0,harry_potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is first movie out of the eight movies to not have Lord Voldemort in it. It does have new characters and new adventures in it that are worth meeting and worth enjoying at the same time. It's very hilarious, violent, and dramatic at times."

1.0,harry_potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban,"Prisoner of Azkaban is the stylistic peak of the film series, and the last Harry Potter movie that didn't feel like the director was trying to get the movie out of the way with as little thought as possible."

1.0,harry_potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban,Even better than the first two (and those were classics) by embedding amazing visuals with a new direction that feels even more magical. Lets not forget the amazing music by John Williams- he outdid himself again. This film is amazing.

1.0,harry_potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban,"After his huge success as a director in the first two movies, Chris Columbus was served to be the co-producer with David Heyman and Mark Radcliffe. Michael Gambon replaces the late Richard Harris to play the role of Headmaster Albus Dumbledore."
1.0,harry_potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban isn't just great because of its terrific acting, magical effects, brilliant story, and mystifying action, but also because the presence of Alphonso Cuaron adds an exciting style to the Harry Potter saga. 10 out of 10 AMAZING"

1.0,harry_potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban,"Although Alfonso Cuaron only lasted for one film in this franchise, it was the one that swung the series into darker territories. Cuaron masterfully handles the whimsy and magic with a new, mature tone."

1.0,harry_potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban,The Prisoner of Azkaban for me is easily the best film in the series and was also probably my favorite book. Alfonso Cuaron does not disappoint.
1.0,harry_potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban,The best of the series by far. Cuaron's talent immensely changed the Harry Potter' s universe for good and served as foundation for the tone of the remaining of the sequels. The series lost a lot when Cuaron declined directing the rest of the episodes.

1.0,harry_potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban,"Three times a Charm! Alfonso CuarÃÂ³n became the first Director to truly and properly catch the magical essence of J.K.

1.0,harry_potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban,The best of the series thanks to Alphonso Cuaron who can do no wrong in my book. He is the reason the later HP films are so good by setting the ground work in this film. This is the only film in the series that stands alone without the aid of its siblings.
0.0,harry_potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban,Worst harry potter movie ever. It doesn't even deserve the name. I can't believe they even let them release it. It was beyond awful- if you hadn't read the book you didn't understand it and if you had you were so pissed you saw red. It was random and confusing and just plain bad.

1.0,harry_potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban,"Possibly my favorite movie of the series.

1.0,harry_potter_and_the_half_blood_prince,"David Yates finally caught the twist about Harry Potter : that, in the complex universe of J K Rowling, one of the sources of ""magic"" is the embody of metaphor - Yeats constructed there the image of this sixth HP movie."

1.0,my_fair_lady,I love Liza Doolittle.
1.0,my_fair_lady,Possibly the best telling of the story. Audrey is lovely - and convincing as she steals every scene.
1.0,my_fair_lady,i just love this film. the only bad thing is that when they sing they where dubbed
1.0,my_fair_lady,The very delightful adaptation of one of the longest-running Broadway musicals is exactly the sort of formal Hollywood spectacle that just isn't made anymore.
1.0,my_fair_lady,"one of my all time favorites, just wish she had picked the young cute guy. he wad a better choose.."
1.0,my_fair_lady,A classical film for all ages...
1.0,my_fair_lady,Watched this after seeing a production in Oregon. Loved the movie just as much as I loved the play!
1.0,my_fair_lady,"One of the finest musicals ever made and a great romantic achievement in the history of film. It makes you sing, laugh and sigh."
1.0,my_fair_lady,"Cute Ms. Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn) is ghastly blasted by accent mocker and linguistic specialist, Higgins (Rex Harrison) whose inclination towards perfect English accent makes him take up a challenge to turn Doolittle into a upward class lady. Funny and beautiful."
1.0,my_fair_lady,LONG LIVE REX HARRISON
1.0,my_fair_lady,A bit long but worth it. It's by far my favorite musical I've ever seen.
1.0,my_fair_lady,"Boasting incredible performances by the elegant Audrey Hepburn and the oustanding Rex Harrison, George Cukor's My Fair Lady is entertaining, beautifully made, charming and hilarious, building an ageless masterpiece of the musical genre that still manages to generate a comment on society."
1.0,my_fair_lady,The accent makes it entertaining for me.
1.0,my_fair_lady,"Rex Harrison gives the best performance of his career, however, the movie's ending is remarkably horrendous!"

1.0,my_fair_lady,"wow, Audrey Hepburn like i've never seen her before. She proves that she can be versitile in her roles, and i was blown away by the whole film. The songs and dance, and costumes were quite a sight. Anyone who loves Breakfast at Tiffanys would adore My Fair Lady aswell."

1.0,my_fair_lady,It's charming and fun and has an interesting plot. And Audrey Hepburn has to be one of the best actresses that ever lived.  Come on. No one can hate this production?  But if I must pick a flaw out of this. It would be the tunes not being melodious and memorable enough.

1.0,my_fair_lady,"By George! They managed to outshaw old GBS... Never has a musical score been written so wonderfully in step with the original text (Pygmalion). And, of course, it helps that the great Rex can't carry a tune but stays wonderfully in rhythm during his recitatives."

All and all, the movie is a pinnacle of story telling and drama of the animation world."
1.0,princess_mononoke_1999,"Princess Mononoke is a classical film, not to mention the hard-boiled action and stuff.

1.0,princess_mononoke_1999,"Quite easily Hayao Miyazaki's best film. You can talk up Nausicaa all you want; it can't compare to this. Nature is revealed to be flawed, too, and man isn't representing the Devil Incarnate.  Cram it, James Cameron. Hayao Miyazaki has done it right."

1.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,"It's visuals may not be of the comprehension of some viewers (inluding me) but that can't remove the fact that Yellow Submarine is more than a musical, it's an authentic piece of art. Even many years after it's release, it has the same magic."
1.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,Endlessly inventive animation invigorates this tale of the Beatles saving a psychadelic fantasy land from a nasty horde of invaders. The images stagger the imagination and overall the film serves as the perfect complement to the Fab Four's late 60's material.
1.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,My favorite movie ever!

1.0,ponyo,This is a cute movie!
1.0,ponyo,"To me (my opinion) it is the best picture of 2009. It totally blows Avatar out of the water (and I love that movie too). Whenever I'm down and feeling sad, I play any one of Miyazaki's films and I feel good about everything again."
1.0,ponyo,"Once again Miyazaki shows the world how to do animation. This simple innocent story looks stunning (esp in HD). It made me want to live in the town where it is set! In many ways this story feels similar in tone to Miyazaki's other work ""My Neighbour Totoro"" (16.12.10) (26.10.11) (19.10.12)"

1.0,ponyo,This was another classic in my eyes
1.0,ponyo,"Beautiful, imaginative and utterly adorable."

1.0,ponyo,"Miyazaki has done it yet again. Absolutely beautiful film, wonderful story and his way of portraying little girls as strong, capable figures is inspiring and makes me proud to show his films to my own daughters."
1.0,ponyo,"My 2-3 year old nephew gets so excited when he watches this film. He sits and is completely enraptured the entire time. There are very few films for which this is the case. Miyazaki creates magic, and this goes back to the roots he created with Totoro. A wonderful film."

1.0,ponyo,Miyazaki dose it again. Just amazing

1.0,ponyo,Absolutely loved this one. So cute and visually stunning. The story is deep and enjoyable to children and adults alike. I am now officially a fan of Hayao Miyazaki. His animations have not yet disappointed me.
1.0,ponyo,"The animation tops everything Disney has ever done and the story, while a little complicated for children to grasp the whole depth, just means as kids watch it over and over as they mature they will always learn something new from it. Young love is the strongest love of all."
1.0,ponyo,"Hayao Miyazaki does it again. Ponyo recaptures the same magic left off from Spirited Away. English voice casting helps enlighten some of the strong points of each of the characters in this, once again, fantastic animated movie."

1.0,ponyo,Loved it. My son too!!!
1.0,ponyo,I love this movie!!!! Reminded me of the Totoro movie which I was obsessed with when I was little. Beautiful to look at with quirky and adorable charaters in a story that is based on my favorite movie in the world The Little Mermaid. Love!

1.0,ponyo,"Magical. Miyazaki dazzles, as usual, with his incredible imagination and entrancing stories. It is, however, more entertaining when watched with the original Japanese track and English subs."

0.0,spy_kids,"How the hell is the rating so high on this one? This movie blows. It's really just creepy to watch, the plot is childish (as it's supposed to be, no doubt), and the acting sucks. Why would people over the age of 10 like this? I don't like you Robert Rodriguez."
0.0,spy_kids,"So dumb, even for a kids movie. The special effects were absolutely horrible. It seemed like a made for tv movie that you would see on Teen Nick. My four year old didn't even like it as much as other kid movies. I don't understand why the Critics rated this so high. Bizarre."

1.0,1010792-its_a_wonderful_life,"Contrary to popular belief, I love this film because it's terribly depressing. Even with the love of family, Bedford Falls is the best you can hope for--for me, this is about settling, and while I might not agree with the message the story is told uncommonly well."

1.0,my_neighbor_totoro,"One of the first from director Hayao Miyazaki reminding us all of childhood bliss. I LOVE TOTORO, how he is designed and his personality (those faces!). The film needed more of the Totoro, which is my only objection. Brilliantly designed and directed."

1.0,straight_story,M-F-O8.6[David Lynch]
1.0,straight_story,Wow... It's a must see movie... That's all I need to say.
1.0,straight_story,"To put it simply, this is the most beautiful movie ever made. Period."
1.0,straight_story,"Very slow, yet beautiful. It's all worth it for the ending."
1.0,straight_story,"Very delicate, warm and beautiful movie. While different from most movies of Lynch, it actually has the same delicate touch as the Elephant Man, which also was based on a true story."
1.0,straight_story,David Lynch se aleja de sus temas habituales y nos ofrece una historia simple y cautivante a la vez. Tiene muchos puntos a favor la mùsica hecha por el gran Angelo Badalamenti las actuaciones de Sissy Spacek y un portentoso Richard Farnsworth. Entrañable e imprescindible pelìcula.
1.0,straight_story,"David Lynch's ""straightest"" story ever (that of an ailing elderly on a near-impossible road trip to see his estranged brother for the last time) is also the sweetest and saddest."
1.0,straight_story,"Sincere, sweet tale illuminated by the late Richard Fransworth's Oscar-nominated performance. A real winner..."
1.0,straight_story,Best movie of the 90's.
1.0,straight_story,The Straight Story was a excellent move.
1.0,straight_story,Touching and very well played
1.0,straight_story,What a touching story of love and friendship. 5 star perfection.
1.0,straight_story,"May, shockingly enough, be Lynch's best work. Touching, extremely well acted and shot, and introspective about life, family, and the journey we all take, together and alone. And very down-to-Earth for Lynch. Farnsworth, though, deserves and award for this one."
1.0,straight_story,I remember almost crying the first time I watched this film. It doesn't try to be a tear jerker but that's partially why it succeeds
1.0,straight_story,Revi ontem e pareceu-me perfeito.
1.0,straight_story,Great story about real courage
1.0,straight_story,Sissy is wonderful in this.
1.0,straight_story,"Truly brilliant. Understated, beatifuly shot. The acting is natural and subtly engrossing. The soundtrack is haunting and moving. You will need to.concentrate as the film is slow bit worth every bit of effort. One of the greatest."

1.0,sound_of_music,My absolute favorite movie of all time! I can watch this over and over!

1.0,sound_of_music,Beautiful. Sensitive. Powerful. Epic.
1.0,sound_of_music,How can anyone find a single thing wrong with this. gorgeous from start to finish! If you've had a bad day have a sing a long with the Von Trapps!
1.0,sound_of_music,"Finally watched this glorious film right around the holidays. Yes after 23 years, I finally watched it. And boyyyyy was it a golden.

1.0,sound_of_music,Definitely a high point for Julie Andrews.
1.0,sound_of_music,Casting is everything. These characters were made alive by the people who played them. The looks on their faces in certain scenes is so real and believable. The music and acting is the bench mark for me.

0.0,sound_of_music,"There really should be a support group for the psychological damage inflicted upon children who had to sit through this awful thing because it was ""good for them"" at a point when they didn't have the power to just say no when their parents dragged them to see this atrocious thing."
1.0,sound_of_music,If your not familiar with musicals. . .this is where you can begin. Based on the True story of the Von Trap family who use great family music to escape Nazi occupied Austria.
1.0,sound_of_music,Classic - Love this movie.
1.0,sound_of_music,"Let's get to the point, Sound of Music is one of the best musicals I've seen. Julie Andrews had a high goal to meet after doing Mary Popins and exceeded that goal. The singing was wonderful and so was the acting. The kids were perfect and so was all the other cast."
1.0,sound_of_music,"I think that giving it a perfect five star rating is very acceptable. Sure, some say it might be cheesy, but it tells a very grand tale. One that has violence, romance, a certain contempt feeling to it, and of course singing. The Sound of Music should be able to last decades."

1.0,sound_of_music,Possibly one of the safest films around for family viewing for all ages without watching Disney. Of course it is a quintessential fight between good and evil but it is predominately a happy film with some delightful music that lifts the spirits during an economic recession.
1.0,sound_of_music,The Sound of Music is one of my all time favourites. How could this not be in the 90%s?

1.0,sound_of_music,Still great even in 2014!
1.0,sound_of_music,"Never have I seen a film so full of the exuberance of life. Cleverly scripted, irresistibly warm, and overwhelmingly hopeful, The Sound of Music remains the most compelling and enjoyable musical ever made, and probably always will be."

0.0,muppet_movie,Wow. I saw the new Muppet movie and thought it was terrible- watched this one to compare it. This was slow and draggy and barely managed to keep my 2 yr old's attention. I must have been thinking of the Great Muppet Caper. Skip this one.

1.0,enchanted,Amy Adams is so cute in the best collaboration of live action and animation in a Disney movie since Mary Poppins and Roger Rabbit. This heartfelt and hilarious fantasy with a great twist proves the theory that love conquers all only happens in Walt Disney films. I was enchanted. Pardon the pun.

1.0,howls_moving_castle,One of my favorite miyazaki films along with Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away. The gorgeous visuals and genuine characters more than compensate for the occasionally hackneyed storyline and abrupt ending.
1.0,howls_moving_castle,"Based on a series of children's books that I've never read, Howl's Moving Castle is poignant and tells a strong moral tale wrapped in the soul of a wizard, a witch, a fire demon, and a cursed little girl. I watch this whenever I need to feel there is hope in the world."

1.0,howls_moving_castle,"The strength of Howl's Moving Castle would be its amazing visuals and the steadfast, likable protagonist, Sophie, who shows us an example of a strong, humble and definitely not whiny heroine. It's weakness, however, is the horrible final ending that doesn't sanely explain anything."

1.0,field_of_dreams,"This one continues to be a favorite of mine, more for baseball and the supporting cast than for Kevin Costner. I do like the overarching storyline, though, of Ray Kinsella's tenacity in fulfilling his dream, after actually listening to the voices in his head."
1.0,field_of_dreams,"If you love baseball or your father, this movie will bring tears to your eyes! A beautiful script and avery well acted, this movie will well be remembered for years to come!

0.0,the_muppets,"Not sure if every other critic was busy on their cell phones while reviewing this film but this farce is hardly worth the title of 'Muppet'. As much of a fan of the Muppets as I am, the film hardly lives up to the magic and creativity of the Henson-era Muppet productions. Thumbs down."

1.0,the_muppets,"From a non-Muppet kid, here's a movie that offers more than we could hoped for. Entertainment, values, emotions and rhythm.

1.0,fantasia,Best Animated Feature of All Time.

1.0,fantasia,one of my favorites. this was all done before CGI
1.0,fantasia,"Stunning and beautiful animation matches the music perfectly.

An experience, I believe, that shouldn't be missed by any fan of animation or orchestra music."
1.0,fantasia,"Marvelous animation and wonderful music, a lovely mixture of the two"
1.0,fantasia,"Even at 71-years-old, Fantasia is a unique artistic experience that has yet to be properly duplicated. Walt Disney's one time failure has proven to be one of his biggest successes."

1.0,fantasia,I personally loved this film. I don't think you will enjoy on bit of it if you don't like artwork or music. I loved how they associated the film/ artwork in the same rythym with the music being played. It really bridged the gap between art and music.
1.0,fantasia,Chernabog (Satan) is the most compelling character of the entire film.
1.0,fantasia,Great visuals and Music 5 out of 5
1.0,fantasia,"I really liked this movie, because it is just great and soothing to listen to like it will always but you in a good mood. Also the colors and pictures are very cool too! They use classical music for this movie, like Bach. The first song they play gets kind of aggressive then goes soft."
1.0,fantasia,"Fantasia may not have any dialogue, but I have a feeling that that is what makes it great. The animation is over its head for the 1940s, and the music that accompanies the sequences is charming. This one is still perfect in my book."

1.0,fantasia,"This is, by far, one of Disney's best films of all time."
1.0,fantasia,"It's been said that Fantasia isn't as good for kids as much as it is for adults and nerdy kids. It's defiantly an acquired taste but never the less Fantasia is beautifully made movie with a unique strategy of storytelling, and in my opinion it is the best Disney movie ever made."
1.0,fantasia,This is the closest thing I've seen Disney do that transcends animation into the realm of art. It's real food for the soul stuff. And all of its small failures seem only to add shading and depth to the over all exquisiteness of the film.
1.0,fantasia,The best animated musical ever.
1.0,fantasia,Best Film when I was a child. This is just amazing
1.0,fantasia,music with visual effects in perfect harmony
1.0,fantasia,"An original, inventive, imaginative and creative experience that, found in only a handful of films, allows audiences to create their own interpretations of the images on screen and turn them into meaning. Beautiful, colourful and brilliant, its one of the first exercises in excess movies released."
1.0,fantasia,"Disney's best. It surprises me why films like 2001 and Fantasia (films with little dialogue) aren't common. I know audience have come to except speech in film, but the music gets by so much more and is fantastic."
1.0,fantasia,Ok...we need it with a new full digital recording.We also need another Fantasia in full 3d
1.0,fantasia,"A beautiful, colorful, animated movie with lovely music and excellent animation. 5 out of 5."

1.0,fantasia,"Definitely my favorite movie next to The Wizard of Oz, Fantasia has the sound and picture that captures audiences of all ages. With music pieces like The Sorcerer's Apprentice, The Dance of the Hours, and Ave Maria, this film is indeed one of Disney's best motion pictures if not the best."
1.0,fantasia,Arguably the best animated film of the 20th century.  Rating: Full Price

1.0,coraline,"With an impressive stop motion picture and a twisted, dark and intriguing story, Coraline can not be surpassed by any other movie."

1.0,coraline,Great animated film that has a distinct tone that might not suit everybody. The characters are strong and the direction is faultless. The film takes an interesting turn around the midway point that is typical of the author. I can't recommend this highly enough.

1.0,coraline,Loved it! I know its based on a book which I haven't read but it's imaginative and the action keeps going right to the end. The ending felt a bit rushed though but it would have been too long a film if it was longer.
1.0,coraline,"It is NOT a kids movie. NOT AT ALL. That doesn't make it bad though. Instead, it's one of my top 5 favorite movies of 2009. The animation, the colors, the terror, the 3D, the imagination = S.P.E.C.T.A.C.U.L.A.R."

1.0,coraline,Even though it said 3D I didn't know this was 3D until I got it but it's the best movies like Nightmare Before Christmas I like. It doesn't have all the singing and I love the story and just the way it was made. It was creative and wonderful!!!

1.0,coraline,"Beautiful styling that will have both you and your child's imaginations spinning. It's not quite a Halloween movie, but is definitely a tremendous fall movie to help get everyone in the spirit. The medium, art, color, lighting, and story are tremendous.

1.0,coraline,"Hauntingly deep, beautifully animated and intensely dark, Coraline is a perfectly realized interpretation of Neil Gaiman's novel, capturing the spirit and horror flawlessly."
1.0,coraline,A wildly imaginative and beautiful looking film. The animation was superb and the film was far darker and creepier than might first appear. There were some brilliant character designs and the music was spot on! (24.5.09) (21.10.09) (19.4.14)

1.0,rango,"I have a special needs child that has watched this over and over again. The show gets more hilarious every time. Extremely clever and phenomenal animation. I rank this as all time greatest animation. Might call me crazy but I have seen it no less than 300 times, and would watch it again. Five stars"
1.0,rango,I don't know why but I enjoyed this movie VERY much. The plot was very clever and the characters very well designed.
1.0,rango,Really enjoyed this movie. This one is for big kids like me.
1.0,rango,Gore Verbinski's vision can be seen in every inch of this flick.
0.0,rango,"This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Who ever thinks this is a good movie has no taste. The acting is quite mediocre, along with the plot being dumb and unoriginal. And I thought spaghetti westerns were bad. It's just bad!!!!!!!!"
1.0,rango,it was a funny and cute movie me and my family love it
1.0,rango,"""As long as that there sign hangs.... We got hope.""  -Rango"
1.0,rango,"One of the best westerns, kids movies and animated films ever. It isn't perfect, but its damn near close in my book."
0.0,rango,This was probably the worst child movie I'd ever seen.
1.0,rango,One of Johnny Depts best performances since Pirates.
1.0,rango,Love the movie! Fun for the whole family!
1.0,rango,Exotic style of animation and different kind of showing its creativity... Near to perfect actually...
1.0,rango,One of the best movies
0.0,rango,What a bad movie. This is nothing for kids...
1.0,rango,"This is a very fun movie, but not for young kids. Hard to believe this is a Nickelodeon movie."
1.0,rango,"Amazing, funny, just a must watch. Wasn't expecting such a good movie !"
0.0,rango,I wanted to watch it because of johnny depp but..not really my type of animated movies...
1.0,rango,"Intelligent, humourous and taking a different turn with your typical kiddy movie. Rango is striking with it's fantastic script, voice acting and great direction."
1.0,rango,I like rango the movie!
1.0,rango,"A surprisingly wonderful animated film with stunning animation, a wonderful script, and a typically great performance by Johnny Depp."
0.0,rango,"It was terrible from start to finish. No like-able characters, dry acting, weak plot, just a big flop. Pretty much any other disney movie is better than this."
1.0,rango,Perhaps a weird and offbeat film but full of humor and an enjoyable story not only for kids but fro any age. Oh and I love Johnny´s western accent.
1.0,rango,It is so rare to find an animated movie with such a story and that is so hilarious.
1.0,rango,An enjoyable animated film that is entertaining for everyone!
0.0,rango,I was incredibly bored by this movie.

1.0,rango,"Very good and funny move with classic references, that will blow your mind"
1.0,rango,"Best kids show for grown ups, ever. Any kids show that has the words ""prostrate"", ""thespian*"" and ""mammogram"" hidden in the detail goes beyond clever. Bravo."
1.0,rango,This is a review on 6/20
1.0,rango,a very good animate movie with a creative cast and special for all the familie.
1.0,rango,One of my favorite movies of all time

1.0,rango,This was a great Johnny deep movie and he was so great at this lot .
1.0,rango,Really good for kids
1.0,rango,"This is my favorite Johnny Depp movie. Pirates? Ehhh...it had its moments. At least here, he eats from a Jar of Dirt/cigar ashes."
1.0,rango,"I loved the animation and to me every minute was originality, a refreshing maneuver away from the typical animated films of Hollywood."
1.0,rango,Funny and a little twisted here and there.
1.0,rango,"Original, creative and beautifully and comically rendered. Rango is one of the best movies of 2011 and one that showcases Johnny Depp at his flashy, unique and quirky best. And is also a surprisingly fun and entertaining tribute to the classic Western films of old. 5/5 stars."
1.0,rango,So amazing and funny!!
1.0,rango,"Its a really cute movie, my ONLY problem with it though is that watching literally makes me so thirsty lol..."
1.0,rango,Any hardcore moviegoers will love this movie. It's full of references and adult humor. Johnny Depp's voice acting is a highlight as well. This really isn't for kids or casual moviegoers because I can't imagine them getting any of the jokes. This was probably the best comedy of 2011.
1.0,rango,Loved it! Had humour depth to it & Rango is pretty awesome!
1.0,rango,This is my favorite movie ever! I can watch it over and over without getting sick of it
1.0,rango,"A surefire classic with a great performance by Johnny Depp. While I won't be in line for the next 'Pirates of the Caribbean' movie this summer its a lot better than his last movie ""The Tourist"". Great for the whole family!"
1.0,rango,"We just finished watching this movie. I am totally gobsmacked! Superb animation, endearing and wonderful characterisations, highly entertaining for the whole family with plenty of action and adventure, along with a beautiful storyline built around self-belief."
0.0,rango,Sorry this one has Johnny Depp in it.. I saw some of it but Johnny Depp couldn't even hold me.
0.0,rango,"Terribly choppy story line, mingled with pathetic humor and beautiful graphics. The critics are very wrong on this movie. It sucks, the end."
0.0,rango,I utterly despise this movie. What is the world coming to if this is what we feel the need to fill children's heads with?
0.0,rango,The Animation is discussting.I don't remember a thing.
0.0,rango,"Rango is fun for youngsters, but it's western feel is too spaghetti western for my liking."
1.0,rango,what a great movie with so many levels and so much archetypal imagery - loved it!!!
1.0,rango,This film is dripping with quality from start to finish. Absolutely superb.
1.0,rango,my fiance loves this movie because he's funny in this movie

1.0,rango,This movie is perfect for family and friends to watch with each other.
1.0,rango,"Absolutely delightful, but not a little kids' film. Much more geared to the tween and teen set, with some adult chuckles and a little raunchy humor."
1.0,rango,Hilarious and adorable! :)
0.0,rango,"Personally. this movie was so bad that the 3 year old, the adult and the stoner could not get into it at all and we turned it off after the first 30 minutes."
1.0,rango,"I am biased because I love Johnny but the film was amazing it all looked very natural, I loved it!!"

1.0,rango,By far one of the greatest CGI Animated Movies ever!
1.0,rango,U cant never go wrong with Johnny Depp
1.0,rango,"Jack Sparrow is now a chamaleon, and instead of being a pirate he is an actor pretending being a sheriff, well what I have to say about this movie is.... MAGNIFICENT! BEST WESTERN EVER!"
1.0,rango,This is the strangest film but is wonderful and realistic.Johnny Depp is great as Rango and the fantastic cast of desert critters are believable and very funny.The whole thing smacks of Blazing Saddles with Lizards and its unmissable
1.0,rango,Dark but fun for the kids
0.0,rango,"There is a fine line between being a tribute and a shameless pilferage of ideas. Rango is sadly the latter. Unoriginal and uninteresting and unfunny. I probably enjoy pointing out the movie references watching SCARY MOVIE, DATE MOVIE, MEET THE SPARTANS. etc"
1.0,rango,"Didn't expect this movie to be as good as it was, it's not what you will expect, a very good movie though."
0.0,rango,couldn't even watch all the way thru
0.0,rango,horrible movie. Boring. A few funny parts but that's it. The story was dum
0.0,rango,Did not appreciate the bad language and high violence in a children's movie.
0.0,rango,"While slightly entertaining at first, the movie quickly progresses to overly dramatic and downright inappropriate for young children. I was disappointed by the language and would have liked to see a PG-13 rating on this movie."
1.0,rango,"Great film, underrated."
1.0,rango,It's going to be a tough call for best animated movie of the year between this and Kung Fu Panda 2

0.0,rango,Predictable and boring.

1.0,rango,Not since the original Toy Story did i have such a good time watching an animated movie!
1.0,rango,"Not since 'The Incredibles' have I marveled at how incredibly good an animated film can really be if the script and special effects are first rate. The cherry on the cake for mine was the brilliant performances by Depp & Co. Blue Ray, here I come ..."
0.0,rango,I have no idea why this movie even got more then 1%

1.0,rango,The best non Pixar film
1.0,rango,"I think this is one of the greatest animated movies, but it's not for your elementary schoolers. It's a great movie for teenagers, though. And if you're an adult who's watched a lot of movies, chances are you'll enjoy the constant references and shout-outs."
1.0,rango,"Its funny, creative, and overall a really nice tribute to old western films! This film seems a little underestimated by the publc, but is still s great fun film! I reccomend this film to all, especially those who like western films!"

1.0,rango,Flawless animation and surprising Pixar style poignancy at times
1.0,rango,I've never been so grateful for water.
0.0,rango,I saw this in theaters and could not stand it. Great animation but it took me half the movie to finally get into the story.
1.0,rango,"A fantastic animation and movie and a real surprise! I didn't think I would like this as much as I did! Great humour, fantastic voice cast, great western setting and imaginative characters make this a real gem. Johnny Depp was fantastic as the lost chameleon! (7.3.11) (8.7.12)"
1.0,rango,It was a cute movie love Jonny in it

1.0,rango,"This was a really cool movie. Great story and amazing special effects, everything an animated movie should be."
1.0,rango,"What distinguishes Rango most is its intelligent premise that makes this animated feature not exactly for kids. Excellent job, Gore Verbinski, for your first trial with animated films... It got you the Oscar!"
1.0,rango,"A humble, intelligent homage to a genre forgotten with the talent of Johnny Depp and the references that he brings."

0.0,rango,"I wanted to like this, couldn't make it through the whole movie."
0.0,rango,What the crap was that! I have never been so ticked off at a movie in my life. I had very high standards for this and although it had some potential to be amazing it blew it all out the tailpipe. Sorry but that sucked a big one. Back to the drawing board.

1.0,1010939-jason_and_the_argonauts,"wow I thought this movie was fantastic, the scene with the skeltons was ace and apparently they took 3 months to do that one scene, it's a great film and I have it on DVD, it starred Todd Armstrong and John Crawford"

1.0,1010939-jason_and_the_argonauts,"For it's time, it had fantastic special effects (courtesy of the great Ray Harryhausen), but that isn't the only thing great about this movie. It's amazingly acted, very entertaining and one of my all time favourites."
1.0,1010939-jason_and_the_argonauts,The best use of the Greek Gods in any film so far -- and the fight with the skeleton army is a landmark.
0.0,1010939-jason_and_the_argonauts,"MMPORG-like telling of Jason's quest to retrieve the Golden Fleece, steeled by the guiding words of the goddess Hera. 'Zeus can't drive men to do what you have done. They drive themselves. So that the gods may know them, and that men may understand themselves.'"

1.0,1010939-jason_and_the_argonauts,This movie really did create stop motion and therefore is a true great - it also inspired CGI which will be used probably with less creativity in the new clash of the titans movie
1.0,1010939-jason_and_the_argonauts,The genius of Ray Harryhausen! Unbelievable special effects!
1.0,1010939-jason_and_the_argonauts,Classic Ray Harryhausen movie. Fantastic special effects for the time and the sight of Talos the Bronzeman moving still sends a shiver down my spine. Simply awesome.

1.0,1010939-jason_and_the_argonauts,"Now this was a great film with great acting and fantastic special effects. There have been 2 other remakes of this movie and they both are far below the quality of the original.

0.0,up,"Pull back from the cute humor and bright colors and you might realize the (hopefully)unintended message of this movie is that life sucks and all your dreams will fail. Seriously, list the main characters and what we know about them. Pretty depressing for a movie called 'Up'."

0.0,up,"Overhyped, Overblown, and Overrated, it can't be overstated. Animation that boast a greatness to come leaves us with unimaginative characters and a forced jumbled plot that takes itself WAY to seriously. Any genuine feeling soon becomes sappy in the run of its manipulative story telling."
1.0,up,"A clever, heartwarming masterpiece. Everything about the film works: the comedy, the story, the main characters, the side characters, the animation. Movies don't often come as perfect as this one."

1.0,up,"Any movie that can tell such a cute, depressing, and detailed story in such a short time, being the opening, is just perfect. I cried before the true adventure even began... I don't know what that says about me, but it says a lot about the movie."

1.0,up,Watched before July 2012
1.0,up,"This film is spectacular, it's start is heart wrenching, it's middle is funny, and the ending sends another perfect Pixar message, no matter how old you are it's never too late to have or be someone's adventure."
1.0,up,"another winner from Pixar. Simultaneously heartbreaking and remarkably uplifting, Up is one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen this year"
1.0,up,My favorite Disney/Pixar movie
1.0,up,The first 15 minutes of this movie. Wow. That alone is worth the price of admission.
1.0,up,"Brilliant film with many morals, themes and frienships. This is a film with a unique twist, and it made 4 unlikely people (and animals) best friends. Another great Disney film."
1.0,up,The Best Pixar movie besides Toy Story
1.0,up,"Brilliant, cute, action packed emotional film with a great plot."
1.0,up,"An amazing animated film, truly a joy to watch. Funny for grown-ups and kids alike, and the story is definitely suitable for both as well. A serious movie despite plenty of laughs to go around."
1.0,up,My daughter loves this movie!
1.0,up,"Seen this so many times, but I wouldn't mind watching it again. It's cute, clever makes you feel happy, and the sad beginning really hits you. I'd say one of Pixar's finest newer films."
1.0,up,"Up creates a better love story within 10 minutes between Carl and Ellie, than in the whole saga of Stephanie Meyer's Twilight."
1.0,up,"Defined heartfelt for me. Classic Pixar, Family-friendly story with a deep and touching message in the end. Definitely recommended."
1.0,up,One of Pixar's most touching stories.
1.0,up,"Loved this movie. Excellent story, very touching. I get choked up at the beginning of it and the little scout was 1000% adorable!!"
1.0,up,Another terrific Pixar movie
1.0,up,Beautiful and touching
1.0,up,This is the best Disney animation movie ever
1.0,up,An exceptionally unique masterpiece. Pixar proved it still has what it takes with this one.
1.0,up,I can't even begin to tell you how much I love this movie. The first 8 minutes of the film send you whirling through every emotion you have. This is one of my all time favorite Pixar films.
1.0,up,I could not love this movie more!
1.0,up,"One of my all time favorites. Dug steals the show. The first few minutes have almost no talking, but still told one of the best love stories ever. If you didn't cry in this movie you're a liar."
1.0,up,"A beautiful film for both children and adults alike. With the unusual quality of primarily being a children's film, while also tackling some of the deeper themes of life, that adults would relate to, heart-warming."
1.0,up,"Excellent movie! Most depressed Disney movie before Toy Story 3, but still good."
1.0,up,Animated Masterpiece...
1.0,up,"a heartbreaking romance between the old man and his wife, a father and son story between the old man and the kid, and an adventure story. mixing in some elements of a mid life crises film, and fantasy elements as well, and you got one of the best animated films of all time."
1.0,up,"First movie in a while to make me cry. Everything, from animation to storytelling is perfect."
1.0,up,One of the greatest and most tragic love stories ever told and that is just the first 10 minutes. Up has a lot to live up to considering the opening sequence and the plot requires the suspension of belief on epic levels but Up never fails to be great. All I can say is Squirrel!!
1.0,up,"A sad, but still heartwarming Pixar movie."
1.0,up,"Definitely my favorite animated film. One of my favorite all-time films. Arguably Disney-Pixars most sophisticated use of theme, message, and storytelling. At times funny but never gimmicky, at times devastatingly poignant but never sappy. A true must-see film for all ages."
1.0,up,Favorite movie of all-time
1.0,up,"This, in my opinion, is the best animated film ever. It's so touching, and very heartfelt."
1.0,up,Doug reminds me of my old dog it makes me happy
1.0,up,"Pixar's best movie. The plot is the creative, the characters are so loveable and in Dug's case adorable, and I have to mention the beautiful music. I love Up. Not only my favorite Pixar movie but my favorite movie period. SQUIRREL"
1.0,up,My Favorite Pixar movie of them all
1.0,up,"Exceeds expectations, even from Pixar."
1.0,up,"If I'm asked what's best of Pixar, I'll point my finger to this one."
1.0,up,Pixar does it again with this touching masterpiece. Anyone who's ever had a relative diagnosed with a fatal disease will truly connect.
1.0,up,the best kid moviefor adults
1.0,up,This is an amazing movie that proves that anybody can achieve something no matter how old. This is an amazing comedy and a great story. Pixar has done it again
1.0,up,One of the greatest animated movies since Disney's golden age. It tells an important story and deals with a difficult subject but is still fun for kids or anybody really.
1.0,up,This movie is perfect in every single way
1.0,up,nothing beats the first 10mins
1.0,up,An absolute masterpiece from the Pixar brand.
1.0,up,Best animated film in history
1.0,up,I laughed. I cried. I pretty much experienced the full gamut of human emotions.
1.0,up,"The first 7-10 minutes are movie making at its best, encapsulating two full lives in that short space of time. Amazing and deeply moving. The movie gets better from there."
1.0,up,This is 5/5 for the first 10 minutes alone
1.0,up,"by far my favorite pixar movie, possibly my second favorite animated movie"
1.0,up,"One of Pixar's best, what else can I say."
1.0,up,Really nice film can't believe I've only jus watched this.. Pixar r the best I liked the message.. Let things go and there is more important things in life.. :)
1.0,up,I always get tear up at the beginning of this masterpiece.
1.0,up,A movie about loss that leaves you uplifted. Another Pixar masterpiece.
1.0,up,"Pixar's uplifting, yet, somber tale of a widowed man whose journey of seeking to fulfill his wife's lifelong aspiration turns awry is, for a lack of a better word, a soon-to-be classic."
1.0,up,This movie made me cry and had deep underlying message. It was cute too.
1.0,up,Beautiful little love story intro and great message.
0.0,up,It tries to make you feel hope by showing you dazzling animation of an old man and a kid being really high in the sky. But there's no actual thematic elements or characterizations to make you feel this! It left me feeling more angered by fake hope rather than uplifted by real hope.
1.0,up,Great movie! Saw it with my kids and had to hide my tears at one point so they wouldn't see. This movie is way beyond expectations!
1.0,up,"Emotionally charged and very funny, this film will stick with you for a long time."
1.0,up,One of my Favourites
1.0,up,I love ice age 4I love up
1.0,up,"This was wonderful, with some elements that kids wouldn't really get or appreciate. I found the bond between Carl and Ellie touching and I hope I am lucky enough to find a love that lasts like that."
1.0,up,this movie is very tear jerking funny and quite mature at times One of Pixar's best
1.0,up,"Stay away from 3d. Doesnt work for everyone, even if you are pixar."
1.0,up,"""Up"" is one of the deepest films from Pixar. Only the introduction of the film is enough to make you leave the tears from your eyes. Definitely ""Up"" offers more than just a colorful adventure. And it lives UP to its name... XD"
1.0,up,excellent movie. I do not rate movies 5 very often this one is a exception. very funny especially dug. Carl is a grumpy but charming in a way and Russell is the type of kid you want to adopt. all I can say is WATCH IT
1.0,up,"Loved it loved it loved it. Really not a ""kid"" movie, but kids will enjoy it since it's a cartoon and there's occasional silly stuff... really is a story line geared towards adults, though."
1.0,up,I can't explain how great this movie is.
1.0,up,"Genial, super tierna. <3"
1.0,up,The montage about 10 minutes in makes me cry every time
1.0,up,wants to see it soooooooooo bad!
1.0,up,I saw the movie at cinema and really enjoyed it. It is good for adults too!!!
1.0,up,"It's truly marvelous how Disney keeps coming out with endearing Pixar films. This is a film that not only will children of all ages enjoy, but adults might also be touched by the heart-warming aura of Up."
1.0,up,I cryed at the beginning D: beautiful
1.0,up,One of the best Pixar movies ever.
1.0,up,it was interesting and exiting
1.0,up,I did cry but an amazing film :)
1.0,up,"First scene get's me every time....I have much emotion invested in this film (Ellie represents all my could-have-beens and losses) so I may be a little bias, but brilliant telling for a brilliant story. Filmography couldn't have been more perfect. Provides a perfect place on Pixar's Shelf of Fame."
1.0,up,An incredible cinematic achievement. Stirring in ways that may go over the heads of its younger audience.
1.0,up,enjoyable for the whole family
1.0,up,A+ Definitely a must watch.
1.0,up,It's the best movie Pixar has already done.
1.0,up,"A better love story than Twilight is described in the first five minutes. Possibly Pixar's best animation so far, besides Toy Story."
1.0,up,THIS IS A WARM HEARTED FLIM FOR ALL.I LOVED IT..
1.0,up,The most beautiful experience of the seventh art. A jewel of the film that gives a nod to childhood and old age so memorable. An unforgettable experience.
1.0,up,I think it's one of disneys best films and it's truly a rare masterpiece.
1.0,up,One of the best PG films ever made
1.0,up,very good movie I liked it.
1.0,up,The last REALLY good film Pixar made (as of this writing). Like Nemo it's one of the more emotional Pixar films but for the most part it's very light hearted.
1.0,the_little_mermaid_1989,Absolutely memorable and great for anyone of any age
1.0,the_little_mermaid_1989,An charming masterpiece

1.0,the_little_mermaid_1989,"A milestone that marked the Disney Renesaince. A magical under the sea adventure, with amazing and unforgetable characters and gorgeous hand-drawn animation. One of my favourite elements was the music and score that was as wondurful as the story!|It's a 9,1 out of 10|"
1.0,the_little_mermaid_1989,"Unforgettable characters, wonderful songs along with first-class animation to boot makes this film a great starter of the era people refer to as the Disney Renaissance."

1.0,1042582-aladdin,"One of the most exciting films there are. There's excitement, action, drama, and comedy. It's all very well done in here. It's #14 on my list. One of the well known films of the Renaissance era."

1.0,about_elly,So good. Beautifully filmed. Limited dialogue but really exciting story. This was a nice peek into Iranian culture. I really enjoyed it.
1.0,about_elly,"A gripping saga of a holiday gone wrong. Though this film is significantly dark in comparison, many aspects of it reminded me of 'Dil Chahta Hai'. Brilliant acting by the entire cast, and kudos to the director for keeping the plot tight from beginning to end. Highly recommended."

0.0,about_elly,"Save your money, boring with nothing but squabbling!"

1.0,about_elly,I can watch it again and again:)
1.0,about_elly,"one of the best iranian movies! great story, great acting"
1.0,about_elly,"A very simple but powerful story. The story that starts with a trivial event and ends up as a shocking impact, just as life itself. An intense drama that shows different levels of classes and genders in Iran. Even the smallest thing can be profound to everyone involved."

0.0,tangled,Over use of anthropomorphized animals. Way too unrealistic. Plot just doesn't make sense. Does not show true human nature - too much of a kids' movie. Glorification of crime and injustice. A disgrace to democracy by glorifying monarchy.

1.0,antz,Watched it again after 8 years.... Will watch it again right now! Truly captivating!
1.0,antz,'Existentialism is an ANTism.' This has to be one of the best underrated 'kids' film ever. Holds WAY up.
0.0,antz,"When you would compare it to A bug's life, you would be dissapointed how much DreamWorks has copied from it. While a bug's life is childish and funny, Antz uses excessive idiocy to make people laugh. Truth to be told it does not deserve 95%. Good actors have wasted their talents on this film."
1.0,antz,"surprise, it's a cute movie"
1.0,antz,I love the story that the creators try to tell
0.0,antz,"Antz is a movie that takes it itself WAY too literally; and after a while, not only does it become boring, but annoying."
0.0,antz,"Just because there is a prolific director voiced a character, doesn't mean you should look past the actual plot and seriousness of the movie. Blatant rip off of A Bug's Life."
1.0,antz,Simply a great and funny film. I think adults would like it even more than children!

1.0,antz,Great social commentary. competing with pixar even during the beginning
0.0,antz,Slept through most of it.... and gladly!
1.0,antz,A very well executed animated film that has been forgotten.
1.0,antz,"Maybe not by much appealing in color and visual but in the flow of the story and the outstanding star power voices of the the cast, for sure the 'Antz' will certainly captivate you and your eyes to keep on watching..."
1.0,antz,Imagine A Bug's Life but with a better cast and a darker storyline. Brilliant stuff.
1.0,antz,A perfectly funny and entertaining antventure (haha).
1.0,antz,Nice family animation.

0.0,antz,Complete Bugs Life ripoff.
1.0,antz,Great children's movie. It was cute.
1.0,antz,A Woody Allen comedy mixed with Orwellian undertones makes an animated feature that is vastly superior to its Pixar counterpart.

1.0,antz,"I always liked this movie better than A Bug Life,because to me this movie is smarter and funnier"
0.0,antz,I did't like this one much at all. A knock off of Bug's Life which I didn't like much either.
1.0,antz,Woody Allen as an animated ant. What could be better?
1.0,antz,You Just Asume it's Antz. And It is Antz.

1.0,antz,One of those classic CGI cartoons that bring back the happy days of when I was a six year old
0.0,antz,"Should not be on top movies ever. Boring characters, decent plot, nasty animation."
1.0,antz,"In my opinion this is Dreamworks best film. Funny, mature and wonderfully animated, too bad Dreamworks would rather make films stuffed with pop culture references then this."
1.0,antz,love this film so much
0.0,antz,Hated it....probably because it came out the same year as A Bugs Life.
1.0,antz,"The movie's higher intelligence and advanced use of it's premise showcase DreamWork's penchant for non-catering, which makes it's thematics feel more admirable, if a little alienating, considering its time and mixed appeal."
1.0,antz,Woody Allen and Jennifer Lopez made this movie funny and clever. A great family movie for sure.
0.0,antz,This movie is terrible in every way and a horrible excuse for an animated film. The film reeks of Bug's Life knock-off and was poorly executed across the board.
1.0,antz,one of my all time favorites :) great famiy movie

1.0,antz,"Satiric and structured, it's another Woody Allen project that is a winner in my book."
0.0,antz,This movie is bad in comparison to the other bug movies. Woody Allen should stay in human form. Watch A Bugs Life instead.
0.0,antz,Pathetic rip-off of a bug's life.
0.0,antz,For a kids movie i didnt agree with some of the content and therefore would not let my child see until closer to his adolencent

0.0,antz,Watched this years ago and didn't like it at all.
1.0,antz,a joy to watch this is a comedy that is much better then expected. this is an animation that is more for the adults with its complexity and humour. great voice cast and very intelligent writing gives us a comedy you can watch over and over again.
0.0,antz,"Woody is fine, but his humor doesn't translate to adults. If he wants to relate to kids, then he'll have to marry another one. (oh crap that is harsh)"

1.0,karate_kid,"Another masterpiece. ""Wax on, wax off"" = memorable line on top of everyithing else revolving around the famous chemistry between Pat Morita and Ralph Macchio. 80's classic without a doubt."
1.0,karate_kid,"I had a crush on Ralph Macchio, what girl didn't??"
1.0,karate_kid,"The fighting scenes are amazing and they really inspire me to practice more karate, but there are so many other good things about this movie. It's clearly a classical one, it's hard to resist and it's very memorable"
1.0,karate_kid,made me want to do karate but then my mom told me no and the movie thus ruined my childhood
1.0,karate_kid,THIS WAS A GOOD MOVIE TO SEE.
1.0,karate_kid,"If you came of age in the 80s and this movie isn't one of your favorites, you're a disturbed individual."
1.0,karate_kid,this movie is very good i love it the best karate kid

1.0,karate_kid,This was a really good movie. i reccomend to literally anyone looking for a good movie
1.0,karate_kid,"Not sure if part of this rating is influenced by nostalgia, but I will say...there's nothing like the original. That and it's just odd to see how the Jackie Chan and Christopher Smith rendition is almost a cookie cutter remake."
1.0,karate_kid,I have seen this film. It is really good.

1.0,karate_kid,The original and still the best.
1.0,karate_kid,"It's really just a lovable inspirational teen movie. The craziest part is the Cobra Kai, some of the most ruthless teenage bullies ever seen on screen. Pat Morita is also pretty amazing as Mr. Miyagi and Ralph Macchio is probably the most endearing aspect of the whole thing."

1.0,moana_2016,Best Disney movie since Toy Story 3. The only flaw is that it may have been hard for kids to follow. I absolutely loved it though.
1.0,moana_2016,Disney did it again. The new Frozen. Great movie for the whole family

1.0,moana_2016,"Disneys take on the Samoan people when they weren't exploring. I looked it up, they are not Hawaiians.Songs are catchy and well written. New Disney princess is willful and independent, no romantic entanglements."
1.0,moana_2016,"There's something oddly satisfying about a Disney lead character that doesn't have a love interest or a parent that dies. Moana was a beautiful movie! Cute songs and happy feelings. The water animations were spot on, and the ocean spirit was adorable."
1.0,moana_2016,great animation could use abit less of singing but the your welcome and shiny songs were amazing story great johnson does a great job with his character and i think this has to be one of disney's best movies looking forward to cars 3
