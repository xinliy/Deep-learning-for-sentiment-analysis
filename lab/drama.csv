1.0,searchers,"The Searchers was definitely a treat to sit through. From its great musical score, amazing action scenes, terrific script, and fantastic performances (particularly from John Wayne), it is regarded as one of cinema's finest westerns for a damn good reason!Overall Grade: A+ (10/10)"
1.0,searchers,"Has to be near top of the list in all genre of movies, of Westerns it is at the top. A near Perfect Movie. Wayne is brutal, maniacal and all too Human as Ethan Edwards. Rest of Cast in also Top Notch."
1.0,searchers,"A must see. A masterpiece. Perhaps, just the best movie in History.View several times, last time in the Filmoteca española (The Spanish Film Library, Madrid)"
1.0,searchers,May be the best western film ever made. Unapologeticly shows the struggle of life on the frontier and the thin line between revenge and redemption.
1.0,searchers,"Westerns have a history of simplification and, for a long time, needed a more thorough tackling of the genre. That is why John Ford's darker undertaking starring the Duke, himself, is both a relief and the greatest revisioning of the heart of Westerns."
1.0,searchers,Best Western ever alongside Unforgiven.

1.0,searchers,One of the grandest films ever made.
1.0,searchers,The Searchers has beautiful photography with such elaborate details on composition and framing. The story intensifies as we are also given some good humour and lighter tones. The sweeping scope of the valleys and deserts are attractive and there's a great handle on its art production.

1.0,searchers,"Without a doubt one of the greatest movies of all time and certainly up there as one of the best westerns of all time, if not the best western of all time. A forgotten, under-appreciated movie that just happens to be a masterpiece."
1.0,searchers,One of those great films that even those that love it are a bit ambivalent about and I think that is a very good thing. Great art should make you a bit uncomfortable.
1.0,searchers,Greatest Western of all time!!!!!

1.0,searchers,"One of the best westerns ever made, unforgettable film."
1.0,searchers,The weight of a 3 religious epic jam packed into a less than 2 hour cowboy epic chronicling mainly the exploits of 2 men in a game of cat and mouse with the band of Comanche that slaughtered their family in the postbellum West.
1.0,searchers,I don't think Western genre can get any better than this.
1.0,searchers,"This one breaks the tomatometer. If you can, get a copy with Director Peter Bogdanovich's commentary. It opened my eyes to the Master's skill."
0.0,searchers,"This movie tries to create complex characters but fails with inconstancy, bad acting, and cliches. Its ""grand"" vistavision cinematography is great at first but goes nowhere. Nothing in this movie develops well. This is probably the most overrated western if not movie of all time."

1.0,searchers,One of John Wayne's best westerns. What a loss Jefferey Hunter was.
1.0,searchers,"Featuring moments of splendour and one of John Wayne's greatest performances, The Searchers studies the disunions of American character, with its quest for justice, its lust for violence, its spirit of companionship and its search for freedom."
1.0,searchers,The Searchers is captivating and surprisingly grim at times.

1.0,searchers,"Vengeance in its obsessive, destructive form, that's what John Ford's masterpiece is all about, and what Ford's mis-en-scene expresses so eloquently, inimitably. With perhaps one of the greatest final shots in all of cinema."
1.0,searchers,Both Ford and Wayne at the top of their game.
1.0,searchers,"A film that demands multiple viewings with Wayne at his finest as conflicted Ethan Edwards and the poetic prose of Ford's master hands evident throughout, especially when placing Edwards violent past and consequential present against the gorgeous backdrop of Monument Valley."

1.0,searchers,"Probably the best western I have ever seen. This almost makes True Grit look like a joke, and I gave it 5 stars. John Wayne has got to be one of the manliest men to have ever lived. Beautifully shot, entertaining, and just a great film."
1.0,searchers,"One of the greatest westerns ever made is also one of the most multi-layered with its messages of racism, bigotry, and the cruelties of the dying western frontier. This is arguably John Wayne's finest performance. A must see for Cinephiles!!!"
0.0,searchers,To dislike this genre of film is apparently tabooed but I have to say I found the portrayal of Native Americans/Indians in this film nothing short of offensive and I saw John wayne as the very definition of racist.. But seeing as the movie was made during that time.

1.0,searchers,"Though a film from 1956, The Searchers remains one of the darkest films about human nature I have ever seen. It's dark tone is balanced with its themes of family life and merry gatherings, and in doing so provides both the perfect combination of entertainment and poetic storytelling."
1.0,searchers,They just don't make Westerns like this anymore.
1.0,searchers,My favourite western (probably). A grim story and the cinematography is brilliant and has been immitated in many films since.

1.0,searchers,A classic John Wayne film. Could possibly be his darkest role.
1.0,searchers,Brilliant movie! Beautifully shot with great performance by John Wayne.
1.0,searchers,The best western ever made... there will be no arguments.
1.0,searchers,"In my opinion, the best work of both John Wayne and John Ford. The scenery alone makes it worth watching. John Wayne's most powerful role; how the Duke was not even nominated for Best Actor baffles me."
1.0,searchers,"That'll be the day when anyone is justified in criticising The Duke! This is not only a great western (and in my mind the best western ever made), but it's also one of the greatest movies ever made. The colour and expanse of Monument Valley surely influenced Kubrick when he made 2001."
1.0,searchers,this is a film that was filmed when films were films.

Young Jeffrey Hunter and Natalie Wood, who both died young, are terrific. And what's a John Wayne/John Ford movie without Ward Bond?"
1.0,searchers,I love how John Wayne just walks off into the sunset after 5 years of chasing after his niece. I suspect that he was going to take a nap.

1.0,selma,"Selma is a gripping recreation of the titular march bolstered by David Oyelowo's magnificent and uncanny performance as Martin Luther Jing Jr. And it avoids the demonization of whites where many have fell before. We don't need a full MLK biopic, this will do well."

1.0,selma,A perfect movie of a part of the life of Martin Luther King
1.0,selma,"I think this is a must-see movie, esp right now, in this part of the world. Part of the success is the way the movie focuses on the strategy sessions in the background and the ethical dilemmas that arise out of these sessions, in contrast to the completely unreflective police brutality."

1.0,selma,great portrayal of what they had to go through
0.0,selma,"Boring, makes things up. Democrats are cheering a movie where they show how black people have overcome the oppression of Democrats. The movie portrayed MLK as an opportunist, and not a great man. I was hoping this would have done a better job of portraying MLK, but it failed."

1.0,selma,Selma is purely phenomenal. The story and scenery really accurate to the real life March. David Oyelowo was Dr. King in every way shape or form. Interesting why he didn't get the Oscar Nod but he outshined this role in my book. My favorite Black History movie since the Color Purple.

0.0,selma,It seems like a subject too serious for the factual and historical inaccuracies that dominate the film.

1.0,1012928-m,"Lang's haunting masterpiece has much in common with another cinematic treasure, 'The Night of The Hunter'"
1.0,1012928-m,"One of the best suspense films of all time. If you haven't seen this, you should. 1001 movies to see before you die."
1.0,1012928-m,"You have to be an Avengers-spoiled brat to not like this. This is absolutely phenomenal for its time. The fact that it's relevant and great still, shows that this is a true masterpiece."
1.0,1012928-m,This movie is sooo good. How can you not like a movie this? M is one of those classics that will always stand the test of time. Definitely deserves a re-watch.
1.0,1012928-m,"Suspenseful, emotional, gritty, this movie has it all. A story about a child murderer is so gut-wrenching, yet so good."
1.0,1012928-m,Surprisingly sordid for its time.
1.0,1012928-m,"A rare nail-bitting soul-searcher, ""M"" still stands as one of the greatest films ever made for cinema. Director Fritz Land and actor Peter Lorre help deliver a timeless Masterpiece."
1.0,1012928-m,"Amazing. Simply an incredible film. Pete Lorre in his best performance is disturbing and somehow tragic. Masterfully made. It says a lot that a movie this old, is still more effective than most movies these days..."
1.0,1012928-m,A tour-de-force of directing that I really need to rewatch.
1.0,1012928-m,Perfect proto film noir/mystery/social commentary. Most entertaining game of cat and mouse ever depicted.
1.0,1012928-m,De lo mejor que he visto en my life
1.0,1012928-m,"Police procedural, thriller, indictment of society . . . Lang is doing so many things so well at once it's enthralling. That a nearly 85 year old movie is still relevant isn't entirely surprising, that it may still be controversial, is."
1.0,1012928-m,Still as shocking today as it was 80 something years ago.
1.0,1012928-m,"Masterful in every respect, M provides a scathing indictment of mob mentality and the ultimate negligence of those who wish to proceed by way of emotion rather than reason, a universal message as relevant today as it was back in 1931."
1.0,1012928-m,"-IGNORE THIS ""OUT OF FIVE"" RATING4/4Chilling early talkie about a child murderer put on trial by citizens, not the law. Fascinating psychological thriller asks not to sympathize with its killer, but to understand him. Peter Lorre is still great, many famous scenes, and yep, one of the greats."
1.0,1012928-m,Ground breaking and the creation of the psychological thriller. This is truly a masterpiece which will live in history.
1.0,1012928-m,The first definitive psychlogical thriller.
1.0,1012928-m,"Fritz Lang's M stands as a landmark psychological thriller that dares to sympathize with a child murderer who can't help himself. Lorre's debut is one for the ages, and over 80 years later, this landmark looms large over every psychological made. Beyond Essential."
1.0,1012928-m,Considering how this film floored me! I can't begin to imagine how it floored audiences in 1930's whom were totally unprepared for such a disturbing theme and genuinely frightening performance!
1.0,1012928-m,Shot him like a mad dog!
1.0,1012928-m,Just never equaled. Peter Lorre's interpretation remains a must see. Absolutely no mistake in the staging. How is it one cannot stage and/or perform movies like that piece of art more than 80 years later
1.0,1012928-m,"Possibly one of the greatest films ever photographed. As always, I'm rendered speechless by Fritz Lang's modern cinematic vocabulary. Such an artist ahead of the curve, and by decades. Stunning cinema, even 80+ years later."
1.0,1012928-m,Gets better with each viewing.
1.0,1012928-m,My fourth favourite film of all time. Needs to be seen by all. Indescribable perfection.
1.0,1012928-m,Brilliant film. Explores the murders from a different perspectives good storyline. Great directing. Eerrily good.
1.0,1012928-m,"Fritz Lang's incredibly haunting and tragic murder-mystery is more emotionally and politically potent than the majority of films...period, to be frank, and it is only heightened by the lack of soundtrack."
1.0,1012928-m,masterpiece... nothing less.
1.0,1012928-m,"I was surprised at how little Lorre was in this until the end. The whole Mob vs. killer aspect was very interesting, and the ending is pretty great. Probably the darkest movie made for the next 30 years or so, really ballsy and powerful subject matter for an early sound movie."
1.0,1012928-m,cristoddio peter lorre me lo sogno stanotte.
1.0,1012928-m,Good example of film noir.A little slow at times but the story is thrilling.Peter Lorre is great here.
1.0,1012928-m,"Unquestionably one of the greatest pieces of cinema ever made, Fritz Lang's M is the blueprint for the modern murder mystery. Exquisitely shot, expertly written, and as suspenseful as any modern motion picture, M is a dark, groundbreaking noir thriller every film fanatic should see."
1.0,1012928-m,Fritz Langs landmark film is a masterpiece with a capital M. The cinematography and the atmosphere is just fantastic as well as the performances especially from Peter Lorre who is just phenomenal in his role. The ending scene belongs to some of the greatest scenes in cinema history.
1.0,1012928-m,Very interesting movie indeed! The dubious actions preformed by the lead actor (Peter Lorre) made me pop my monocle.

1.0,1012928-m,"A milestone psycho-thriller with striking cinematography, profound social views, and a great performance from Peter Lorre."
1.0,1012928-m,"This is Peter Lorre`s best performance. He is totally captivating in the pain he exudes as criminal who utterly detests his own crimes, yet there is nothing sympathetic about this pathetic character. Lorre plays this character as only he could... brilliantly!"
1.0,1012928-m,"Probably Fritz Lang's greatest film, and one of the best psychological thrillers i've ever seen. M is haunting, suspensful and it's complex story keeps you thinking throughout the entire movie. I highly recommend it."
1.0,1012928-m,Amazing Film...a German classic restored.
1.0,1012928-m,Throw such trashes like A Clockwork Orange straight to the dust bin where it should belong ha
1.0,1012928-m,"Clever, gripping, and emotional. M touches on more than simply murder, but the repercussions and reactions that are part of the process. An excellent film on the study of people and their thought process during a time of horror and hunting for the killer."
1.0,1012928-m,Intelligent and evergreen!
1.0,1012928-m,"phenominal. After roughly 35 years of cinema's existence, it's amazing how ahead of his time Fritz Lang was in both storytelling and visual aesthetics."
1.0,1012928-m,Awesome film. It had to be really pushing the envelope in 1931.
1.0,1012928-m,"M is a dark and gritty film that set the stage for the noir genre, all the while telling a gripping and thought-provoking story."
1.0,1012928-m,O que Ã (C) justo afinal de contas?
1.0,1012928-m,"Un film de virtuose, porteur de rÃ©flexions. Incroyable."
1.0,1012928-m,"Suspenseful and haunting themes, sharp editing, a scary performance by Peter Lorre, a sharp screenplay and fantastic direction make Fritz Lang's first talkie ""M"" a noir masterpiece way ahead of its time."

1.0,1012928-m,Eek he has an M on his coat! Man is that guy paranoid. One amazing noir film!
1.0,1012928-m,"One of the first psychological thrillers, and dare I say, the absolute best. One of the most powerful performances from Lorre and Franz Becker. Not to mention the STUNNING imagery, the best imagery from a murder/thriller at least. This is the epitome of German cinema."
1.0,1012928-m,"Both creepy and fascinatingly deep, ""M"" features some of the most memorable scenes to ever grace the world."
1.0,1012928-m,One of the best movies I have ever seen. Incredibly story arc and incredible performances all around. It is just ingenious at every turn. Hands-down one of the greatest films of all time.
1.0,1012928-m,Done unlike any other movie I have ever seen. Suspenseful entertaining with a totally different structure for plot. Peter Lorre pulls of desperation like no other.
1.0,1012928-m,Very good and interesting movie. Excellent especially for the time it was made.
1.0,1012928-m,"Peter Lorre gives a great performance as a troubled psychotic, cinematography is also brilliant."
1.0,1012928-m,"Way ahead of its time in style and content, ""M"" gives a whole new meaning to the phrase ""a jury of your peers""."

1.0,1012928-m,"If your a serious lover of film it's one of those movies you just need to see. An early example of suspense, it's a tight thriller, with a message, given to us by Fritz Lang...he's kinda a big deal."
1.0,1012928-m,Absolutely brilliant and classic in every way. Still a great film.
1.0,1012928-m,Timeless masterpiece that brilliantly attacks the increasing mob-rule politics of 30s Germany why also delivering an exciting serial killer thriller with a heist thrown into the mix!
1.0,1012928-m,all the town's criminals are tired of being constantly harassed by police because of a child killer on the loose. so they all get together to find him themselves. a cool premise and a very well done film
1.0,1012928-m,Fritz Lang's legendary picture is notable for its superb construction of fear and excitement...Peter Lorre gives a greatly ambiguous performance as the child killer that strikes fear in pre-war Berlin.
1.0,1012928-m,Innovative in it's use of sound. Peter Lorre gives a perfect performance - unfortunately it haunted the rest of his acting career
1.0,1012928-m,'M' is loaded with memorable images and a stillness in the sound gives us one of the rarest movie experiences of all time. Much thanks goes to Criterion for bringing back a lost and undisputed classic. The best foreign film ever made and it's tied with 'American Graffiti' as my favorite film.
1.0,1012928-m,Best film ever made.
1.0,1012928-m,The best film with a single letter for its title! It's also quite good apart from that.

1.0,1012928-m,"Absolutely masterful - dramatic, epic and controversial. Lang provides us with another masterpiece and this is a film everyone should see"
1.0,1012928-m,"An exceptionally well crafted thriller. It uses it's devices impeccably to both draw and blur the line between justice and vigilantism, understanding and sympathy, and the sickness in us all. A true cinematic classic."
1.0,1012928-m,"No wonder this movie is considered one of the best made in history. Fabulous acting, cinematography and plot. Wow."
1.0,1012928-m,"Flawless, totally. It took Hollywood always to catch up with films of this caliber (with the possible exception of ""All Quiet on the Western Front"")."
1.0,1012928-m,"Four years after his smash hit Metropolis, master of German Expressionism Fritz Lang premieres his first sound film, M. Lang uses sound in M not only as a key plot device, but also as a nod to classical music on which the story is based."
1.0,1012928-m,Fritz Lang's legendary picture is notable for its superb construction of fear and excitement...Peter Lorre gives a greatly ambiguous performance as the child killer that strikes fear in pre-war Berlin.
1.0,1012928-m,That whistle tune.....oh monstrosity.
1.0,1012928-m,"Considered as the finest work of Fritz Lang, M delicately profiles a wanted psychopath with stimulating themes and striking complexity that helplessly infects the audience with questions on justice and ethics. Remarkable."
1.0,1012928-m,"Ett mästerverk. Har inte sett den här sedan filmkunskapen i gymnasiet slog det mig. Allt jag egentligen mindes var stämningen och Peter Lorres stora, rädda ögon. Så det kändes lite som att se den för första gången."
1.0,1012928-m,"Expertly made way ahead of its time, extremely chilling and expertly acted. The way it shows how tortured the murder is, and how everyone in the entire town is against him. Must see for any film fan."
1.0,1012928-m,I heard it's the first serial killer movie ever made and it's really interesting the see how the shocking appearance of this psychopath wreaks havoc among all the underworld. It has some remaining feeling and style from the silent movies... ;)
1.0,1012928-m,My favorite film by Fritz Lang. The film to lay down the psychological thriller formula for later generations.
1.0,1012928-m,"A truly dark thriller about the depths of the mind of a serial killer. This movie doesn't rely on violence to get its disturbing point across. It relies on the disturbing Franz Becker character, and its dark atmosphere."
1.0,1012928-m,"It may start a little slow, but man....this movie is pretty damn intense."
1.0,1012928-m,Lorre's finest role.
1.0,1012928-m,Peter Lorre's 1st and best role typecast him for life. He's a childkiller who can't help himself while Police and local criminals (whose activities are hurt by the Police search ) are searching for him. Peter's plea at the end when captured by the criminal element is unforgettable.
1.0,1012928-m,As good as any movie ever made.
1.0,1012928-m,"Amazing. When you consider how much of sound cinema appears to have been - if not invented, then - used so confidently by Lang in 1931, your jaw hits the floor. The story, the treatment, the tone... it's amazingly relevant. We have not come far in 80 years."
1.0,1012928-m,Is tha monster the worst?
1.0,1012928-m,"AWESOME movie! Highly recommended great classic movie, featuring a legend in acting, the fabulous Peter Lorre!! Rent it, download it, buy it - just see it SOON!"
1.0,1012928-m,Great Movie indeed. Peter Lorre performance as a child killer was on the mark. He played it as well as he possibly could in the 1930's. The movie is timeless each movie generation will love this work of art.
1.0,1012928-m,When I finished watching I found myself wondering...when was this filmed? A timeless classic.
1.0,1012928-m,Surprisingly modern with a vicious portrayal of a child hunter from Lorre.
1.0,1012928-m,As powerful a film now as it was 80 years ago
1.0,1012928-m,"Brilliant. The images really struck me, and the script as well. Although I may not have understood all the camera techniques, and some of Peter Lorre's acting reminded me a little too much of ""Arsenic and Old Lace,"" ultimately, it's all genius."
1.0,1012928-m,M.a.s.t.e.r.p.i.e.c.e.
1.0,1012928-m,One of the best movies ever made and like the best Noir ever. And the film is From my favorite director Fritz Lang. Whats not to like? It has an amazing story with all the amazing suspense. Not my kind of story but i really liked this
1.0,1012928-m,"Why has it taken me so long to see this!?Man Fritz Lang you were a mad genius!I love this FREAKING MOVIE, and Peter Lorre you are the perfect creep haha."
1.0,1012928-m,This was a good movie. I really like it. It was very interesting the way that he moved the camera. I think he was an amazing director.
1.0,1012928-m,One of the best serial killer movies i have ever seen. This movie is shocking because you dont' expect these type of movies to have been made around in this time. I give it four out of four thumbs up.
1.0,1012928-m,A great performance from Peter Lorre. I love how subtle and yet poignant some of the most violent scenes are.
1.0,1012928-m,Very disturbing film which has lost none of its power over the years.
1.0,1012928-m,"A truly chilling piece of German cinema. It's Fritz Lang's greatest work, alongside Metropolis."
1.0,1012928-m,"A clever film by Fritz Lang about a serial killer. The story telling, structure and style of this film are absolutely brilliant. An originator of the genre.(53)"
1.0,1012928-m,Lorre is both vulnerable and horrifying as the film's killer.
1.0,1012928-m,"Silly mobs, can't you learn to have thoughts of your own? Best 80-year-old German film I've seen to date!"
1.0,1012928-m,"Chilling, thought-provoking, timeless (mostly). Definitely recommended."
1.0,1012928-m,"Fritz Lang's first sound film certainly packs a punch! Peter Lorre is superb as murderer Hans Beckert and the strong supporting cast include colourful characters such as Safecracker and Dicke Lohmann (Tubby Lohmann). Of course, Fritz Lang's directing is faultless."
1.0,1012928-m,"I was blown away. I'm a bit speechless.  Many ideological debates go on in the film, but what makes the film so interesting is that it doesn't take sides in any of them."
1.0,1012928-m,Wow! An early talkie with an excellent sound design. The ability to use sound isn't taken for granted and becomes another character in the film.
1.0,1012928-m,"Lorre's most dramatic performance, and one of his best. If you're a fan of his don't miss this movie. It is both very artsy and very exciting."
1.0,1012928-m,"I'll never look at Peter Lorre the same way again, nor at my fellow man. A very interesting treatment through image of society and its work toward justice."

1.0,1012928-m,Great ending. Amazing for it's time.
1.0,1012928-m,The first serial killer movie in movie history is simply amazing. This is a must see.
1.0,1012928-m,"Frightening, visually poetic, and haunting, M is a nightmare. The end contains some of the darkest humor you'll see on film, although it's also painfully sad. Lorre is fantastic, particularly in those final scenes."
1.0,1012928-m,Lately i 've been finding myself bored of writting reviews... This is a masterpiece anyway...
1.0,1012928-m,Compulsive psychological drama with some great shots and a superb performance by Peter Lorre.

1.0,1012928-m,"An intense, multi-faceted drama that set the stage (and the standard) for several crime genres even today, and still manages to retain its own uniqueness. Peter Lorre brilliantly plays one of the most dimensional villains cinema has ever seen."
1.0,1012928-m,Excellent Fritz Lang classic thats nothing short of a masterpiece. Peter Lorre is outstanding as a child murderer. This film helped pave the way for films raging Hitchcock films to serial killer films. Its influence and brilliance is readily apparent throughout the film.
1.0,1012928-m,"80 years old, and still stands as one of the great crime suspense films ever made. That's said while ignoring all of the innovations that basically set the rules for making a sound film that are still in use today. If you haven't seen it, well, give it a watch already!"
1.0,1012928-m,A brilliantly paced and structured film. Lorre gives a fascinating performance.
1.0,1012928-m,A dark and relentless thriller that illustrates the mastery of Lang's directoral skills as well as the influence European directors held over the genre.

1.0,1012928-m,"Truly a masterpiece. a stunning and timeless classic from the great Fritz Lang. Peter Lorre does a unforgettable performance as the child murderer Hans Beckert. ""Hans Beckert: I can't help what I do! I can't help it, I can't..."""

1.0,1012928-m,"It's an impeccable film -- a model of psychological suspense and a stunning display of Lang's power and skill. But it's Lorre, in a seamless performance that seems to come from some horrifying source, whose image lingers long after the end of M"
1.0,1012928-m,"""Will nicht, muss! Will nicht, muss!""  the prosecution scene at the end of the movie is really thought-provoking and well-shot. peter lorre does a good job in creating a repulsive, psychopathic killer as well, with spooky popping eyes.."

1.0,1012928-m,"This movie is rad. It's all in German though, so it's not for people who hate subtitles."
1.0,1012928-m,This brilliant film is the precursor to every crime drama that would follow. It establishes the procedural police stuff that has become so popular. Peter Lorre's performance is incredible. His work in the final sequence is especially powerful. This film was way ahead of it's time!
1.0,1012928-m,This classic clearly shows what an underrated actor Peter Lorre was in the US - Fritz Lang recognized his talent.

1.0,1012928-m,"Holy Toledo! This film is extremely scary! The leitmotif will always be on my mind, very influential (Fincher, Demme), the amazing use of shadows, the silence, the controversy. It's just a perfect film from beginning to end."
1.0,1012928-m,Close to 80 years ago when Lang made one of the earliest and finest thriller with a storline that is now common place today. A classic.

1.0,1012928-m,"Fritz Lang is the man, this is amazing! The trial of Peter Lorre's child murder, where he pleads with the criminals that he is compelled to commit his crimes whilst they commit theirs out of choice is one of the greatest scenes in cinema."
1.0,1012928-m,"So, movie ...what do you wanna be when you grow up?Fritz Lang's M!"
1.0,1012928-m,A great Masterpiece about a Child Murder who terrorize Berlin the Police who fail to catch him and the Ringbanden (Organized German Crime) who catch him it's a hillarious Parabel on Mass Hysteria
1.0,1012928-m,"I watched ""Metropolis"" and it was good. But this movie is genius. If you're gonna watch just one Fritz Lang movie in your life, watch ""M."""
1.0,1012928-m,"Although the film certainly shows its age in cinematography and editing (an obvious expectation), its strong script, along with Peter Lorre's excellent performance, drastically improve the overall impressive feel of the movie. (In other words, the film is dated, but still well-worth watching.)"
1.0,1012928-m,A masterpiece of paranoia and guilt.
1.0,1012928-m,A superb film noir by Fritz Lang. I recommend this film to anyone into early cinema.
1.0,1012928-m,"What a great movie. It was full of suspense, and had such a great storyline. Production value was phenomenal, especially for its time.

1.0,1012928-m,Simply brilliant! Peter Lorre gives the best performance of his career. M is a masterpiece that all film lovers can enjoy.
1.0,1012928-m,"What does it say about a German movie made in the '30s that during the scenes depicting the governing officials discussing cracking down down on civilians in an effort to find the killer, all I could think about was September 12, 2001 through January 19, 2009?"
1.0,1012928-m,Le meilleur film que j'aie jamais vu. Tout s'enchaine a la perfection. De A a Z tout est parfait.
1.0,1012928-m,An excellent mystery in both plot and visuals.

1.0,1012928-m,"Still trenchant, and Otto Wernicke plays the same character in ""Testament of Dr. Mabuse!"""
1.0,1012928-m,One of the earliest 'talk' films about a serial killer.. who kills kids! And you know what? It's one of the best ever. Brought to us by the same man who directed the ground-breaking 'Metropolis'.
1.0,1012928-m,A great film by Fritz Lang! One of my favorites
1.0,1012928-m,Fritz Lang's psychological crime-thriller about the desperate hunt for a child murderer is a brillant film full of suspense about vigilante justice versus law and order. A definite must-see.
1.0,1012928-m,Lang's confidence to make a movie at the start of talkies that still relied so heavily on silent passages showed what a master he was. German expressionism gave birth to film noir and much of that debt goes to Lang and this masterpiece.
1.0,1012928-m,This is my favorite film by silent-film god Fritz Lang. It's also ironically his first talkie. M is a masterpiece and one of the bleakest thrillers I've ever witnessed....Wow.
1.0,1012928-m,Eternal Masterpiece for the Ages...
1.0,1012928-m,"one of the top films from the 30's. shows restlessness in a town when police can't solve a crime, mob mentality takes over. witch hunts & false accusations run rampant. kids disappearing, parents can't let them out of their sight and everybody's losing their mind. it's just a great movie"
1.0,1012928-m,"A true cinematic masterpiece! On his first ""talkie"" film, Fritz Lang hits the nail on the head with this gripping story of intrigue and deception... and about finding morality in the darkest of places."
1.0,1012928-m,great german expressionist classic. The first film i ever analysed in my class in university. The first Lang talkie movie. I love the scene with balloon. A classic...one of my 100 top movie of all time.
1.0,1012928-m,This is a masterpiece! Looks like a modern film! Peter Lorre is terrific!!!
1.0,1012928-m,"I LOVE THIS FILM!!! Definitely one of the best in the history of cinema. The cinematography is incredible, and Peter Lorre's performance is flawless. M is an absolute masterpiece. Amazing!! A MUST-SEE before you die. ;)"
1.0,1012928-m,Classic expressionist film from Fritz Lang.
1.0,1012928-m,Amazing movie that is unusually dark even by today's standards. The suspense is stupendous! The use of sound is amazing. The court scene near the end is especially powerful. This movie is a masterpiece!
1.0,1012928-m,"Incredibly dark film for 1931, but it does reflect the tensions of the time. Fritz Lang did an amazing job with his first talkie."
1.0,1012928-m,Very few movies can grab you and hold on from the first moment. Yet M succeeds in griping on to you every time you watch it.
1.0,1012928-m,The best noir film ever made. Hands down.
1.0,1012928-m,"Masterpiece. Extremely well-done and eerie. Very ironic, especially the ending. Brilliant film"

1.0,1012928-m,"Amazing film, strange story. Great but bleak moral. A must see"
1.0,1012928-m,"All serial killer suspense movies owe everything to this movie. Okay, maybe that is a slight exaggeration but this is one of the best examples of the genre."
1.0,1012928-m,"The Quintessential masterpiece of German cinemma, because it is foreign my generation is missing out on this masterpiece"
1.0,1012928-m,"Seriously creepy, a landmark film."
1.0,1012928-m,cinematically fascinating. Fritz Lang used some shots that were not made popular until Citizen Kane (ten years later)!
1.0,1012928-m,"Fantastic movie and a great example of early sound cinema from Germany. The film deals not only with very dark issues, but also with the problem of retribution, which is just as prevalent today as it was in 1931."
1.0,1012928-m,"Probably one of the most significant films ever made, inspiring genres from serial killer to film noir. M stands for masterpiece and masterclass."

1.0,1012928-m,"For Fritz Lang's first ""talkie"" he is so far ahead of his time with the audio, even if some sound effects are missing, who cares? Sound plays a major role in the film. The opening scene breaks my heart. I like the negative portrayal of the police...but in the end, we can't say who's the bad guy."
1.0,1012928-m,"An amazing movie! It was iconic for its time, and the themes still resonate today. Peter Lorre pulls off a wonderful performance, and Fritz Lang puts you at the edge of your seat."
1.0,1012928-m,This is brilliant! It's a classic. Miami Vice even made an episode based on it. (My second husband was an extra in it.)
1.0,1012928-m,"Peter Lorre is a big baby of a man who murders children. Coupled with Lang's expressionist style, child murder never looked so cool"
1.0,1012928-m,The subtlety is scarier than seeing the gore!
1.0,1012928-m,The director Fritz Lang considered this terrifying and morally complex Masterpiece to be his finest work.
1.0,1012928-m,"Haunting, atmospherical and captivating german horror-crime tale, masterfully crafted by Fritz Lang and starring the ever mesmerizing and intriguing Peter Lorre."
1.0,1012928-m,amazing a masterpiece
1.0,1012928-m,The police and the criminals are out to catch the child murderer. Peter Lorre was a perfect choice for the role of child murderer. Evocative film There are versions with different endings. Try them both.
1.0,1012928-m,Pretty much the best movie ever made.
1.0,1012928-m,Yes yes yes! If only actors were this emotive nowadays...all fakes I tell ya!
1.0,1012928-m,Fritz Lang's 1931 masterpiece about a child murderer who holds a city in a grip of fear has lost nothing of its effectiveness. It is the stuff nightmares are made of. It has been re-released this week on dvd. Don't miss it. This is far more than just cinema: this is revolution.
1.0,1012928-m,The birth of Suspense.
1.0,1012928-m,Revamped Review forthcoming
1.0,1012928-m,"Great film, has held the test of time, great acting great everything"
1.0,1012928-m,It always amazes me when you see a film made so long ago (77 years!) that still feels current. Some of the camera work is pretty impressive for its time as well. Loved Peter Lorre. Terrifying. Vile. Riveting.
1.0,1012928-m,Very well made. A very interesting story that has it's foundation in eerie truths. Lots of symbolism. The movie comes together very well. Great acting.
1.0,1012928-m,What a great movie.A film about a city getting crazy after several kids are kidnapped and murdered.And this is a film from 1931! - Just a year after films stopped being mute.Amazing!

1.0,1012928-m,"Golly, people in the thirties smoked alot! greatest serial killer movie ever."
1.0,1012928-m,"Who cares what I have to say, see the damn movie, it's worth your 2 hours to see this kind of filmmaking."
1.0,1012928-m,Amazing film. You nearly don't notice that it's a film from 1931. It's that exciting and suspenseful. And Lorre's fabulous.
1.0,1012928-m,"The first and still, so far BEST movie about a murderer ever made. Brilliant cinematography and amazing acting, put together by a genius director. A movie that should not be missed by anyone."
1.0,1012928-m,"Amazing cinematography, suspenseful storyline (not so much in not knowing the murderer but in what will happen next), and Peter Lorre's first starring role. Great movie."
1.0,1012928-m,Helluva story. Amazingly crafted. Incredible performances...way ahead of its time. Creepy as shit at times.
1.0,1012928-m,The great grand-daddy of all psycho thrillers!
1.0,1012928-m,Brilliantly directed thriller as both cops and underworld criminals hunt down a child killer in Berlin. Breathtaking cinematography plus Peter Lorre's unforgettable performance make this an absolute classic.
1.0,1012928-m,"The first, and best serial killer movie ever made. It hasn't aged one second since it came out."
1.0,1012928-m,"Three cheers for no protagonists, no winners, no trust, and no hope."
1.0,1012928-m,Amazingly good from the cinematography to the acting (Peter Lorre is terrific) to the shades-of-gray morality questions.
1.0,1012928-m,"Hands-down the most haunting film I've ever seen. Made two years before Hitler came to power, it is also a damning critique of Pre-war Germany."
1.0,1012928-m,"Un superbe film efficace, deroutant. Un film vu au lycée que j'ai aime revoir plusieurs fois depuis."
1.0,1012928-m,An absolute masterpiece. As dark and creepy as they come.
1.0,1012928-m,"One the best classic movies ever made, a bit slow paced in the begginning, but gets sooo much better."
1.0,1012928-m,One of the best films I have ever seen.
1.0,1012928-m,A real thriller in time...is that past have passed?!!!
1.0,1012928-m,Lorre and Lang at their best
1.0,1012928-m,uno dei più belli di sempre
1.0,1012928-m,"As creepy as movies come. And even creepier is the clarity of vision that Lang had in seemingly anticipating the rise to power of Hitler and the Nazi party.  Also Peter Lorre's best role: simultaneously sympathetic, pathetic, and horrifyingly evil."
1.0,1012928-m,"A very well though out movie that shows the proces of the police trying to catch a child killer. Very interesting concept, especially for that time period as it seemed as if movies were heavily cnesored at that time. A young Peter Lorre hives a great performance."
1.0,1012928-m,"Peter Lorry's ""mercy! Mercy!"" will forever rattle around in my mind. not often noted in film reviews, M is often sited by historians as a work of art that is meant to portray the dissatisfaction and angst in Wiemar Germany."
1.0,1012928-m,"Hands down my favorite film of all time. The writing, acting, directing was all incredible. This is Fritz Lang's haunting masterpiece. Visually stunning and way ahead of its time."
1.0,1012928-m,"One can see how the great Alfred Hitchcock was influenced by the equally great Fritz Lang by watching M. No need to actually FILM the act of violence; in M, less is much, much more. A fantastic film, and a true classic."
1.0,1012928-m,"There isn't much that can be said about this film that hasn't been said before. This is a grat, important film and I cannot recommend it highly enough."
1.0,1012928-m,"Peter Lorre's a badass, and so is Fritz Lang. I never thought watching a pedophile could be so fascinating. Awesome."
1.0,1012928-m,I wish I knew how to text an eerie whistle.
1.0,1012928-m,CLASSIC! Peter Lorre is amazing at the end! All the corridors and shots through doors really enhanced my empathetic view as everyone closed in around M!
1.0,1012928-m,one of the best movies ever made.
1.0,1012928-m,"The economy, austerity and directness of the films of Fritz Lang made him one of the most profound, and precise filmmakers."
1.0,1012928-m,"One of the best films ever made in any country. Lorre (in his pre-Casablanca/Maltese Falcon, ""Bug-eyed Creepy Guy"" typecasting days) gives the performance of a career and Lang invents cinematic tricks from whole cloth that are still being used 70 years later. ""M"" is for ""must see"""
1.0,1012928-m,Legendary but only in german
1.0,1012928-m,The beginnings of an expressive sound cinema...
1.0,1012928-m,"One of the creepiest movies ever made. Peter Lorre is brilliant as the compulsive child killer. It gets so bad that even the street gangs and mobsters start tryng to track him dowm. The ending with the criminals putting Lorre on ""tiail"" is brilliant"
1.0,1012928-m,An excellent portrayal of both the murderer's mind and the mob's reaction to the horrible events. Hauntingly beautiful camera work and Peter Lorre is amazing.

1.0,1012928-m,"This was Fritz Lang's first time using sound in film- that statement needs to be said because it is not seen. Lang is a master at his medium and proved it with his use of sound in the film, M. A breakthrough through all barriers."
1.0,1012928-m,Otra obra magistral de Fritz Lang. Uno de los temas mÃ¡s controverciales en cine mudo.
1.0,1012928-m,"I only watched partial from one of my class, but I already addicted to this movie."
1.0,1012928-m,"I can't stress how much I love this film, nor can I describe why in less than 500 words. If you haven't seen it, watch it."
1.0,1012928-m,"The first and one of the best movies about a serial murderer ever made. Though it is a German film, it's premise can be applied to any culture, and Peter Lorre is really unsettling in the role of the murderer."

1.0,1013139-maltese_falcon,"Classic film noir with Humphrey Bogart in one of his signature roles as morally ambiguous, hard as nails Private Eye Sam Spade. The cast is amazing (many of whom would return in 1943's Casablanca) and the dialogue crackles with wit and cynicism. A high-point of the genre!"
1.0,1013139-maltese_falcon,If you like Film Noir you'll like this. Bogart is great as Sam Spade and Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet shine as well in character roles.

1.0,1013139-maltese_falcon,"Bogie as Sam Spade? Damn! Watch this movie, if only to see Bogie light up for the umpteenth time! Seriously, one of my faves, a time-less classic with an all-star cast. Astor, Greenstreet and Lorre also get a nod."

0.0,baby_driver,Would have been more entertained by watching a compilation video of dogs defiantly taking a crap on a rug. Every character was as empty as the bowels of those aforementioned dogs. And I believe the script could have been picked out of one of the aforementioned dog logs.
1.0,baby_driver,"One of the most original and best movies of the year. Do not miss this one. The marketing wasn't really that good and I almost passed on it, but got a dvd and figured I would give it a chance. I am going to watch it again, which I hardly ever do."

1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Uppos vielä paremmin kun muutama vuosi sitten. Amerikkalaista elokuvaa parhaimmillaan. Uskomaton tunnelma. Loistavaa tekstiä, samalla tavalla ei ole hahmojen luonteita esitelty muissa filmeissä. Bogart ja Bacall - ehkä valkokankaan paras pari."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,One of Best Movies of All time and Humphrey Bogart is the Man
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"I have to admit, I still have no idea if the plot makes sense to me or not, but the movie is so atmospheric and the chemistry is so strong between Bogie and Bacall (obviously) that I've come to the conclusion that I don't really care if it makes sense or not."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Noir, another dead film genre. Maybe it's for the best, I don't think modern Hollywood is capable of making something this good."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Bogart is classic and as always Bacall plays off him so damn well a true classic
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Its nearly impossible to hate a movie featuring Bogart,and it gets even better,knowing that Howard Hawks directed it! An incredibly underrated film."
0.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Unbelievable characters and poor acting make this noir-esque romp a pile of rubbish. Especially when compared to say, 'The Maltese Falcon'."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Fucking brilliant. One of the landmark Film Noirs out there. Bogart does some of his best work in this film and the scenes between him and Bacall are excellent. Also one of the most badass Bogart fights happens in this one.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"The Big Sleep is the definition of a Film Noir. While it has a overly complicated plot, the screen chemistry between Bogy and Becall is the reason to watch, mainly the scenes where the dialogue goes above and beyond acting."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Brilliant stuff. Full review later.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Brilliant stuff. Full review later.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"One of the most perfect prototype detective movies. Sure the story is a little muddled, but we'll blame that on Raymond Chandler."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Nevermind how convoluted the plot is. The chemistry between the two leads is palpable, with deliciously ambiguous dialogues and latent sexuality. One of the many Hawks' masterpieces."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"One of the greatest Film Noirs of all time. With great suspense, quotable dialogue and an unforgetable chemistry between the leads (Humphery Bogart and Lauren Bacall), the Big Sleep is living proof that they don't make them like they use t"
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,My favorite so far of the noir genre.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"One of the best, not fully recognized, movies of all time with a stunning, talented cast. The chemistry on screen between Bogart and Becall has all been lost in today's movies. Whenever I have a bad day, The Big Sleep is rated up there with Ben and Jerry's and a soft pillow."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Great movie from the great Howard Hawks starring the equally great pairing of Bogart and Bacall. In general the film benefits from a great cast with Martha Vickers standing out most among the supporters. A real classic of a film which should be sought after by all fans of movies.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Yes its black and white, I'm not sure that you can beat the writing!!"
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Baserad på Raymond Chandlers bästa roman och med Bogart i sin enda film som Philip Marlowe (han borde gjort fler), med hans fru Lauren Bacall. Kemin mellan dem är elektrisk, precis som i deras första möte på vita duken i Att ha och inte ha."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Don't try to understand what's going on.Just enjoy it.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Bogey and Bacall don't get any better than this one!
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Fantastic detective noir.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Lauren Bacall's debut film -- very fun adventure.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Bogart and Bacall practically sizzle in this film. And Howard Hawks tells a fantastic detective story on top of that. Truly one of the all time greats.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,My #1 movie of all time. Bogart and Bacall at their best. Complicated story with lots of twists and turns. One of a very select few movies that I watch over and over again.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"The plot ceases to make sense at some point, but frame by frame and scene for scene the frisson, the humor, the coolness add up to a Bogie-Bacall and Howard Hawks masterwork."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,One of the greatest movies I've ever had to the privilege to enjoy.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Classic noir film. No wasted dialogue, very witty and loaded with double entendres. Plot is convoluted, but adds to the intrique of the movie. Bogart and Bacall never better. Unresolved murder unusual for those days."

1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"""You know how to whistle, don'tcha Steve? You just put your lips together and blow."""
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Fantast beyond film noir.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Bogie was cool. Chandler's insanely clever dialogue was kept pretty well intact. Great Noir. What's not to like?
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"My favorite of all the hard-boiled noirs, Bogart here shows how truly great screen actors can get across an entire character in a single gesture and knowing grin."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Tremendous entertainment with one of the most convoluted plots ever in a Hollywood movie - even the writer admitted he didn't know who committed one murder! But who cares with this lightning pace and great dialouge.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"The direction, music, cinematography, screenplay and performances are all flawless, and make for one of the best film noirs ever made."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Classic B&B;! A must see on a dark and foggy night like tonight!

1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Great movie. Totally amazing. I love Bogart and Bacall, especially before they got married when they starred in The Big Sleep and To Have and Have Not, which I have not seen yet. It is wonderful. I recommend it to all!"

1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Bogart and Bacall; directed by Howard Hawks; Scripted by William Faulkner. What's not to like, right? Convoluted plot, that's what, but hey, you're having so much fun in the noir genre you don't even care. Seminal film noir classic."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Classic film noir - love it
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Another darn good Bogart film. Not as good as the Maltese Falcon but still great.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,The chemistry between these two makes my toes curl. whew

1.0,1002352-big_sleep,the dialogue is perfect and so is lauren bacall.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,One of my favorite movies and probably one of the best noir films of all time.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,best film noir movie EVER
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,One of the essential film noir
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"This is a true classic. The plot is both riveting and ridiculously complex, the dialogue is razor sharp and, of course, its got Humphrey Bogart, who is the epitome of cool."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Brilliant. Smart and funny dialogue and an excellent cast really help this detective story come to life. Just make sure you pay attention to what is going on.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Absolutely one of my favorites. Bogart and Bacall actually reshot one of the scenes a year later having been married in the interim. Some of the plot is so convoluted as to be incomprehensible. Somehow it all suits the noir underpinnings and carries me away. I love it and watch it time and again.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"a film noir masterpiece, Bogart and Bacall are electric. Wonderful, Wonderful dialouge one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,for me the best Bogart/ Bacall movie
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,no one knows who killed whom in the end because everything is so confusing...but worth watching for things not connected with logic!

1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Noir contorto, ma stupendo sia per gli attori che per i dialoghi, che non sembrano essere stati scritti negli anni '40.Bogart idolo!!!"
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"One of the greatest of all films noir. Bogart is brilliant. Bacall was never a great actress but no one can doubt the chemistry between the two leads. Raymond Chandler's convoluted plot leaves everybody guessing, but the dialogue is scintillating and the performances top notch."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"- This has to be one of the greatest film characters ever. Although I would never call Bogart an amazing actor he completely owns this type of role. The script is phenomenal, the direction is great.. this is Film Noir at its finest. Howard Hawk is a pimp"
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"and the tears flowed like wine... maybe the best Hawks (favorite might go to His Girl Friday, but it's very close); Bogie and Bacall are quintessentially awesome here, as is the script which synthesizes classic Chandler with classic Hollywood noir"
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Can't go wrong with this... Meow
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,definately the best movie they ever did together
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"I barely understand the plot. The plot, however, doesn't matter at all. It's all about Bogart being Bogart, Bacall being Bacall, and me loving every minute of it."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Jeg skulle se den tre-fire gange før jeg forstod plottet (jeg tror, jeg har det nu), som både er indviklet og med spring i handlingen, men hey: fantastisk stemning, eminente replikker og Bogart i sin glansrolle som privatdetektiv Marlowe."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Bogart & Bacall sizzle.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Great adaptation of the book, given the sex and drug references had to be toned down back in the day. Best scene: Bogie & Bacall on horse racing. ""GRRARRR!"""
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"As classic as classic gets; the chemistry between Bogart and Bacall is unparalleled in film history. Casablanca is rightfully famous, but this is Bogart's finest... Words can't do it justice - just watch it..."

1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Howard Hawks directing Bogart and Bacall in a Raymond Chandler adaptation-- you can't get much better when it comes to film noir. The plot is a bit convoluted, but the witty banter, snappy character confrontation, and fast pace more than make up for plot holes."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Soooo sexy and cool!
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Howard Hawks and Humphrey Bogart making a noir? I really can't see at what point this would have gone wrong. The plot is indecipherable, but that's okay, plots are peripheral, anyway."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"My very favorite classic noir. Chandler's convuluted plot, difficult to understand even in the original book, is impossible to follow here; still, I enjoyed every hard-boiled minute."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,El mejor Film Noir de la historia. Una obra de arte que solo se podia hacer en blanco y negro!!! Excelente casting. Excelente vestuario.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Bogart isn't stereotypically good looking, but he ""sure has something"" as they used to say. Throughout this film women just fall at his feet (literally in one case) and you can definately see why. The plot is labrynthine, but the acting and screen writing is classic era Hollywood at its very best."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Bogey and Bacall have breathtaking chemistry in this marvellous Howard Hawkes adaptation of Raymond Chandler's novel. It has the wittiest, most sparkling dialogue and best screenplay you'll ever come across - courtesy of William Faulkner and is a noir masterpiece."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Although the finished plot can be tough to follow, this is an amazing film. Bacall and Bogart are truly amazing together. Their banter alone is worth seeing the movie for."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Bogart just really didn't make too many bad films. Great movie. The remakes aren't a patch on this. Nobody does it like Bogart...

1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"The best film noir in my opinion. Many people prefer The Maltese Falcon, but for me the best film noir is The Big Sleep. All the actresses are gorgeous, great mystery and it's a movie that works beautifully on black and white!"
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"The acting, dialog, Hawks's rapid direction and the chemistry between Bogart and Bacall all add up to something greater than the sum of its parts. The plot is so twisty that even the filmmakers couldn't explain why one of the murder victims was killed. But that's part of the picture's charm."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,I love the way Lauren Bacall flares her nostrils. Great dialogue.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Crime noir meets Bogie. Chandler's hero in both the 1945 pre-release with the more linear storyline and the 1946 version with all the smoldering Bogart and Bacall footage. A landmark.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Classic Bogart and Bacall flick
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Wow! It's as good as Raymond Chandler's book. That's because the screenplay is by another great American writer, William Faulkner.  Humphrey Bogart is cast perfectly as Philip Marlowe. The rest of the cast is great too."

1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"After countless viewings AND reading the book, I still couldn't tell you what happened. As The Big Sleep will attest, who needs a plot when you have atmosphere, attitude, drug-addled teenage nymphomaniacs, and one of the greatest couples in history?"
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"The Big Sleep is a stylish ""Film Noir"" with a fast paced and confusing plot. However, the sharp dialogue and strong chemistry between Bogart and Bacall will make this a hugely enjoyable experience, whether you understand it or not."

1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Awesome! Both the 1945 and 1946 versions leave me wanting more. ""Doghouse"" Marlow is one of my favorite movie characters of all time.

1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Perhaps the best adaptation of a Raymon Chandler book committed to screen, helped i guess by him working on the script. Bogart and Bacall sizzle and lets face it all us guys would like to be as harnosed and arrogant as Marlow and still get the dame. Noir and classic."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,You want good on-screen chemistry? look no further than Bogart and Bacall. This is one of the better movies where they are opposite one another. It's also a much better Bogart-as-detective story than The Maltese Falcon.

1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Boggie and Becal at their steamiest. Hawks has produced a masterful albeit an esoteric noir.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Bogart and Becall. What a team they make. This is my favorite movie with them together. It is very suspenseful and involving.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Undoubtedly confusing film, with more twists than an out of work showgirl's last pair of stockings... but extraordinary for its slick self assurance, dazzling repartee, and the unmistakeable chemistry between Bacall and Bogart."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,one of my favorites. bogart=god
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,lauren bacall is my favorite. she = real woman.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,If I've ever wanted to be some body else it's Bogart. On my best days I couldn't smoke that many cigarettes and drink that much whiskey.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Boggy as a private dick hired not by Bacall as stated in the Flixster review but by her father. Sex, pornographic pictures, drugs and guns...1946 movie ahead of its time. Cool and dark"
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Probably my favorite Bogart film... and Bacall is awesome in it as well; a refinement on To Have and Have Not. Non-stop dry humor and a pretty wild plot make this a must-see film noir film.

1.0,whiplash_2014,"Young & old, precision and technique needs to be clear the way it's meant to be played hitting the right tune, rythm, beat, and sound. Time has changed, but not our taste in good music. The culture of music is within the player and players prior to them."

1.0,1000013-12_angry_men,Even though it takes place in one room for the whole film and it's a bunch of men arguing it still keeps you at the edge of your seat.
1.0,1000013-12_angry_men,"Brilliant! Every actor is committed, every line of dialogue is real, every shot necessary and the plot is sentimental, but the ensemble delivers on such honest terms it's impossible to disregard."
1.0,1000013-12_angry_men,12 Angry Men is incredibly well-written with nameless characters and some of the most consistent topical explorations progressively sought after in film. The dramatics are tense and the technical aspects are smartly choreographed.
1.0,1000013-12_angry_men,"With superb acting and on-point direction, this movie flows with intensity that will have you glued to the screen. As each character breaks down their reasons for doubt, the uncouth and savage build up to the end is truly what makes this a perfect film that remains a flawless, cinematic gem."
1.0,1000013-12_angry_men,"My favourite film of all time, mainly because of the dignified presence of Henry Fonda."

1.0,1000013-12_angry_men,"This masterpiece was Sidney Lumet's first foray into directing and what a debut it was.

1.0,1000013-12_angry_men,"This may be a matter of a personal taste, but I enjoyed this a bit more than Citizen Kane, simply because you get so much out of every character, rather than having every lesser character be underplayed.

1.0,1000013-12_angry_men,I really cannot think of every word right now to describe how much I love this film. I can re-watch it all the time. If I can't re-watch it I can recite almost every line in my head. Great film.

1.0,1000013-12_angry_men,"Sidney Lumet's film is a masterclass in tension. Proof you don't guns or violence, everything in this is wrought out of the words spoken (or not) by the 12 angry men. Lumet had his moments, this is one of the best. A film everybody should see."

1.0,hidden_figures,Really awesome show. It inspires how people coming together to solve problems regardless of race can truly make history happen.
1.0,hidden_figures,"Wonderful, uplifting movie! Makes you appreciate the long struggle that Blacks have faced in the past and present. Also a must see for women of any skin tone. It shows how far we have come, but that we still have quite a way to go to break through the glass ceiling."
1.0,hidden_figures,My 2nd favorite movie of 2016. I was just so sad it took over 50 years to tell this fantastic true story of the brilliant women that helped put the US into space. Highly highly recommend it.
1.0,hidden_figures,"Love this movie! Great acting, inspirational story! Very well-done!"
1.0,hidden_figures,I really enjoyed the movie. It's nice to learn about unknown people who did a lot for this country to make things better and to help other generations learn. It was nice to see some racial tension grow to a level of some comfort for those who weren't comfortable.
1.0,hidden_figures,Excellent movie worth your time and money.

1.0,hidden_figures,"It's just a damn good movie. Space, struggles and pain, and success."
1.0,hidden_figures,"I can recommend this film, a heartwarming true story of 1960's American prejudice and the people who made a difference. Not my favourite film of the season but second place is not bad. See this film"
1.0,hidden_figures,"Best Film Oscar for Hidden Figures 2017.I've really enjoyed all the oscar nominated films - but this film stands out as the clear winner. A cracking true story, with laugh out loud humour, it fills the heart & reminds us of those who have achieved so much with so little recognition. DON'T MISS IT!"
1.0,hidden_figures,One of the best movies ever made!

1.0,hidden_figures,WOW - an incredible account of coloured women in NASA's space program. So beautifully shown.
1.0,hidden_figures,"Really enjoyable, retro romp that obviously glosses over many issues, but makes and entertaining movie. Insightful for any younger audience to understand how technology and social values have ""skyrocketed"" from the 1960's."

1.0,arrival_2016,"It might not seem like much, but ends up delivering much more than expected. Complies and goes that extra mile sci Fi is meant to accomplish. It is a ""must"" (a very enjoyable and EMOTIOnal one) for all sci Fi true lovers."
1.0,arrival_2016,"A near-perfect movie that deals with science, humanity, warfare, family, and the concept of time, but ultimately leaves the question of life and its meaning to the audience. If laser guns against monster aliens are your thing, go see ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" instead."
1.0,arrival_2016,Nothing like a good Ol' fashioned alien movie to make you appreciate your family.
1.0,arrival_2016,Best ever!! Let's your brain fell useful.

1.0,arrival_2016,Great film: atmospheric and haunting. The denouement is very satisfying. I bought Ted Chiang's book and read it after watching. Great job!

1.0,arrival_2016,It tells a story about communication.

1.0,arrival_2016,What a wonderful film. I was a bit confused at the beginning but my confusion was cleared up by the ending. This is by far the best Science Fiction is recent years. Highly recommend for any one who likes a thought provoking story instead of the special effect driven crap that we usually get.
0.0,arrival_2016,Good cast. Horrible movie. Couldn't understand half of the dialog. Long periods of no dialogue at all. Totally confusing. Kept using previous scenes. Don't waste your time.
1.0,arrival_2016,"I gave this movie 5 stars and it definitely deserves it. When the end came around, it gave the movie a whole new spin! This is a movie I could watch over and over again. I highly recommend it!"
0.0,arrival_2016,"This film is probably the most boring i have seen this year, not sure why some are raving over it, it should have been a short 15 minute film. Only watch if you are having trouble trying to sleep."
1.0,arrival_2016,"a good movie , not what I was expecting , Villeneuve brings in the Québec way of doing movies in this masterpiece assembled to perfection in a lower tone. beautiful filmed and wonderfully casted , it is a philophical candy and an ambitious Sci fy loved it"
1.0,arrival_2016,SCI-FI genius!!! Great flick! Got it on BluRay and watch it all the time. Such a good movie! GREAT soundtrack
1.0,arrival_2016,M-F-O8.7[Denis Villeneuve]
1.0,arrival_2016,Wonderful acting by Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner.This film accomplishes precisely and effectively what I expect from science fiction/fantasy: subtle exploration of what it means to be humans in community.
1.0,arrival_2016,"An absolutely excellent film. I went in with no expectations and was blown away by the mood, concepts and the captivating central character."
1.0,arrival_2016,"Finally saw this. Had seen some negative reviews which kind kept me from watching it. Honestly may be my favorite 2016 movie now. Definitely not an action movie, but such a smart thoughtful experience from beginning to end."
1.0,arrival_2016,"Holy crap!! You need to watch it for yourself. It may start slow, but adding the pieces of the plot together along with the characters leads to a fulfilling ending."
1.0,arrival_2016,Seen in cinema- excellent!
0.0,arrival_2016,Awful. Turned it off after. 15-20 min

0.0,arrival_2016,"How did this movie get such great reviews?? This movie was horrible, boring, anticlimactic and had an ending that made absolutely no sense. Waste of time."
0.0,arrival_2016,"So...""Arrival"" was basically the 2007 Sandra Bullock movie ""Premonition"" combined with ""Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind."" Cinematically, it was pretty. Story/Plot-wise, it was predictable and boring. I fell asleep watching it."
1.0,arrival_2016,Good for what ails us right now

1.0,arrival_2016,"Amazing movie, exactly what I want from sci-fi"
0.0,arrival_2016,"Worst movie since ET. Amy Adams is helpless and hopeless. People act in completely unrealistic ways that make no sense. ""Then a miracle occurs"" is the premise of the move."
1.0,arrival_2016,"Made me think. The ideas were intriguing, and there was kind of a plot twist / surprise in the end. A little formulaic about the reactionary nature of humans (or maybe just realistic). I loved the idea that time is nonlinear. And I want to meet those aliens!"
1.0,arrival_2016,Very well done. Amy Adams is perfect. Best Sci-fi movie since Contact.
1.0,arrival_2016,Give it all the praise!!! Amazing movie
1.0,arrival_2016,"Both Villenveuve and Adams are at their best here. Visually and emotionally stunning. I am, and always will be, dumbfounded that Adams did not receive more recognition for her role in bringing this story to life. The character work and use of misdirection is peak storytelling."
1.0,arrival_2016,WOW this is truly a SFX masterpiece!!
1.0,arrival_2016,"A smart, expertly paced and acted sci-fi thriller. Arrival, once again, proves director Denis Villenueve is one of the modern masters of our time.5/5 stars"

1.0,arrival_2016,one of the best scifi
0.0,arrival_2016,This movie was TERRIBLE! How did it get such a high rating? OMG. It was slow and boring for starters. And the end was just... Dumb.
1.0,arrival_2016,Great acting and a great story! The plot twist at the end is one of the best I've seen in a long time! A must see for Sci Fi fans!
1.0,arrival_2016,This is a special movie. It's not an action movie. It's not a thriller. Its not singular. It's nothing so pigeon-holed. It's f-ing smart. It's beautiful. It's masterfully crafted. Stop reading this. Go watch it.
1.0,arrival_2016,Imagine the thrill of Close Encounters combined with the awe and wonder of 2001 A Space Odyssey. Director Dennis Villeneuve and Writer Eric Heisserer are now at the top of my list of favorite directors and writers.
1.0,arrival_2016,Sublime. Perfectly executed and a fascinating look at perceptions if reality.
1.0,arrival_2016,"I am generally not a fan of science fiction or thrillers, but Amy Adams successfully helms this excellent film that questions our pre-conceived notions of what science fiction really can be."

1.0,arrival_2016,Amazing sci-fi movie!
1.0,arrival_2016,Arrival movie is absolutely Glorious
0.0,arrival_2016,"What a waste of my time, confusing and utterly stupid. WTF is what came to mind at the end. I only watched all of the movie waiting for something to tie together, never did. Had lots of questions that were never answered, just like tv show Lost."
1.0,arrival_2016,I think this is a beautiful movie
1.0,arrival_2016,A well-executed science fiction thriller that also carries a thought-provoking concept down to its structural core.
0.0,arrival_2016,"Best movie by far to fall asleep to! Other than that...overrated, boring, and nothing special. Wish I never saw this movie. What a waste of time and money."
1.0,arrival_2016,Enjoyable sci-fi quasi-thriller with some familiar themes from Contact.
1.0,arrival_2016,"Incredibly powerful movie, a true ""statement of the human condition"".This story is a Shakespearean Tragedy masquerading as a sci-fi movie. That it didn't win multiple academy awards is shameful."
0.0,arrival_2016,Normally I agree with the tomatometer and audience score. I found this the most boring movie I have seen in a long time. I actually watched it to the end in the hope that it would redeem itself but no luck on that front.
1.0,arrival_2016,my favorite film <3
0.0,arrival_2016,"Incredibly pretentious. This is a ""chick flick"" disguised as sifi. The style is ridiculously slow. The concept of the aliens was very good, but the interesting part of the movie, how to understand language was skipped over. Silly movie how it got 94% ratings from the pros is a head scratcher."
1.0,arrival_2016,"Thoughtful, emotional and very moving. Something we all think about but can't quite fathom the logistics of meeting intelligent life outside of our own. Amy Adams shines."
1.0,arrival_2016,"Loved this movie, the plot was so brilliant and i feel like it desserved more awards."
1.0,arrival_2016,An absurdly good contact movie made with believe communication and an incredibly dense plot. One you'll want to pay very close attention to.
1.0,arrival_2016,Inspiring! Stunning sound effects.
1.0,arrival_2016,For once a symbolic story that goes against the typical vilified alien invasion type plot. A beautiful message linking advance communication and precognition skills. One of the most emotionally driven sci-fi movies of all time.
0.0,arrival_2016,"Slow, stupid plot, ridiculous ending what a waste of timeWorst movie of 2016"
0.0,arrival_2016,What a confusing mess. This movie was loaded with suspense...and then had zero pay off. This movie is easily one of the biggest wastes of time I've seen.
1.0,arrival_2016,Thoughtful sci-fi drama with all the visual trappings of a blockbuster but none of the bombast. Engages the heart and the mind like all the best sci-fi.

1.0,arrival_2016,A fantastic movie that makes you think. Really beautifully done.
1.0,arrival_2016,A masterclass science fiction that takes multiple viewings to truly appreciate and understand.
1.0,arrival_2016,"Not only looks great, but remains grounded, sustaining a very human and emotional element to the science fiction genre, having a spirit all of its own."
1.0,arrival_2016,"One of my 3 wishes, which for some reason extend to all humanity is to give everyone a common language so 'lost in translation' ceases to exist. This movie shares my desire, thought provoking and beautifully acted."
1.0,arrival_2016,"This has been one of the best movie experiences I have ever had, the imagination and creativity the moviemakers used is excellent."
1.0,arrival_2016,"I love a movie that keeps you thinking after its over, this movie delivers. Amy killed it and Im definetly rewatching this masterpiece."

1.0,arrival_2016,Amazing. This movie is so innovative and interesting. The story and plot line are creative.
1.0,arrival_2016,One of my favourite movies of all time. Amazing. Moving.
0.0,arrival_2016,"I liked the timing and the main topic of the movie. But, the movie proceeds so slowly until the point that it was driving me crazy. I think the exact same plot with exact same acting quality could be done, half the time that this movie took (which is 111 minutes)."
0.0,arrival_2016,"The more I reflect on it, the worse it gets."
1.0,arrival_2016,"This movie is a masterpiece. Every line and every scene is significant and very well though/planned out. The subject matter was brilliant as well, communication...it shines a light on just how complicated it is. This is the best movie I have seen in recent memory."
1.0,arrival_2016,Arrival is an intelligent film that gives a great performance from Amy Adams with language aspects
1.0,arrival_2016,Fantastic. A Must see.
1.0,arrival_2016,"Arrival is something different to the other sci-fi movies, it´s more focus on comunication and inteligence of the humans than the aliens. Amy Adams is amazing so as the story that it will blow your mind at the third act of the movie"
1.0,arrival_2016,One of the best movies I have ever seen by far.
1.0,arrival_2016,"Great movie!!! I am just left with questions, I'll have to watch again and get the answer!Would gladly watch a sequel if there is one!"
1.0,arrival_2016,couldn't take my eyes off the screen. the atmosphere of this movie is truly captivating.
0.0,arrival_2016,Not sure how this show got 93%! Was all excited to see it and boy was it a waste of time. First 45 minutes shear boredom. It was so dark I could hardly see each scene. Could have been so much better. Wish I could get me money back. Human Human Human ink blot ink blot octopus are now aliens!
1.0,arrival_2016,"A really good movie. Im a smart person but I don't know if I'm smart enough for this movie. I really liked it, not one I'll buy but one I'll watch when ever its on to try and better understand it."
1.0,arrival_2016,A tour-de-force. Equally riveting and revitalizing as it is meditative and poetic in its exploration of humanity.
0.0,arrival_2016,This was easily the worst movie I have seen in a while. The boring drawn out plot that had such a poor careless ending. I literally would put this movie on any time you're having insomnia as it is guaranteed to remedy that issue. It only deserves 93% as sleeping medicine. Absolutely awful flim
1.0,arrival_2016,"One of the most underated movies of 2016. An amazing original story, great cast and cinematography. But the music waa on another level. The actors did not have to speak, the music told the whole story."
0.0,arrival_2016,"One of the most boring ""aliens come to earth"" movies I have ever seen. The plot is also implausible and forced. Other than some of the visual effects, the film is unwatchable."
1.0,arrival_2016,"Simply marvelous. Excellent script, actors, everything was amazing"
1.0,arrival_2016,It's not really a complex movie it's pretty easy to understand...it's just meh. Starts strong then gets a tad slow for a hour then gets going last 20 mins. Not really a great story but does make you think about what if you knew your future.
1.0,arrival_2016,Smart sci-fi for adults.
0.0,arrival_2016,Quit possibly one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time
1.0,arrival_2016,Never thought I'd see a movie so thoughtful about Squid aliens and language. But I couldn't be happier about it.
1.0,arrival_2016,A total tear jerker!
1.0,arrival_2016,"Though you will see plenty of nods to past sci fi films and plenty of re-hashed themes, Arrival amply creates an amazing thought provoking sci fi with human morality. Amy Adams is on top of her game once again and once you fully grasp the film and its heady concept, you will be blown away."

1.0,arrival_2016,I absolutely loved the film. It's a quality benchmark for all scifi to come.However... I wonder how would our audience and critics' ratings and reviews would be if there was a review page just for Arrival's Ending (2016).

1.0,arrival_2016,Definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's mind-blowing and yet I still understood it.
0.0,arrival_2016,Nothing happens. Aliens come to save humanity in hopes that one day humanity will save them. One woman is the key and saves both. Aliens leave. The end. No action. Incredibly slow. Nothing to engage the audience. Would never recommend to anyone.

1.0,arrival_2016,The GOOD movie from 2016 about Amy Adams and aliens the government doesn't quite trust. Arrival is smart and stays smart all the way to the end rather than just turning into a CGI action movie in the third act like a lesser movie would have. The twist is great and it makes you think.

1.0,vertigo,"Surreal feeling and elusive, one of my favourite elements of Vertigo is it's hypnotic approach to direction, which takes a decent (yet ordinary) mystery and makes it seem strangely dreamlike. Combined with an outstanding script, cast and score this is easily one of the greatest thrillers ever."
1.0,vertigo,"Erotically charged and beautifully surreal, Hitchcock's Vertigo is perhaps his best film if only because the melodrama doesn't fall short of the mystery, the two are marvelously combined to create a thrilling and suspenseful mystery and a haunting meditation on love and evocation of the unearthly."

1.0,vertigo,"Vertigo is, in a word, unbelievable. Never has a story of obsession sat with me quite like this one. It's a slow, tense burn of a thriller, as well as a genuinely honest and personal drama. I love every frame of this film."

1.0,vertigo,"This is the one. My favorite movie of all time. Was not quite a warm welcome to cinema back in 1958, but in time it would become Hitchcock's masterpiece. Everything from Hitch's direction to a great cast, Bernard Herrmann's score, and San Francisco's setting, Vertigo is that good."
1.0,vertigo,"hands down, vertigo is my all-time favorite film."
1.0,vertigo,"Is it the best movie ever made? Debatable. It's certainly the most artful. Hitchcock's finest achievement is about the destructive power of love, the loneliness of consciousness, the tragedy of cinema, all brought into focus through sumptuous ambiguity and beguiling technical virtuosity."

1.0,vertigo,"Unpredictable, suspenseful thriller. AMAZING."
1.0,vertigo,"Wow, this movie really messed me up when I first saw it as a kid. Kim Novak in that suit - holy smokes."
1.0,vertigo,"Vertigo is bound to have you shuddering in their seat from the minute it drags you in, with a brilliant story and cinematography with typically clever motifs from Hitchcock. Even though the set reminds us of so many other Hitchcock films, it plays out like no other piece in existence."
1.0,vertigo,Did not see that coming at all. Fantastic work from the master himself. I cannot wait to explore more of his works.
1.0,vertigo,"A haunting masterpiece. A slow-burner, and not quite the usual Hitchcock suspense story; Vertigo deals with one man's obsession and personal frailty in the face of mysterious outside forces."

1.0,vertigo,A questionable plot can be forgiven as this film is totally compelling.

1.0,vertigo,"The cover sums it up when it says masterpiece. The look on James Stewart's face as he's looking down followed by the awesome ""vertigo effect"" is enough to give me acrophobia."
1.0,vertigo,"Mind-bending! Alfred Hitchcock is the godfather of ""psychological thrillers""... and Vertigo proves as to why he should be canonized as a saint in the religion of filmmaking."

1.0,vertigo,Perhaps one of the ten greatest films ever made. A true perverse classic.
1.0,vertigo,"This classic is an intense cooperation of lighting, sound, characterization, and emotion that reveals new secrets with each viewing. Though begging for multiple viewings can be interpreted as demanding too much from an audience, this film's beautiful complexity is a joy to unravel."
1.0,vertigo,One word: Perfection.
1.0,vertigo,One of Hitchcock's best. Pyscho's still his masterpiece in my eyes tho
1.0,vertigo,"A beautifully shot, well-acted piece that conjoins the second and third act in such a way that is hard to distinguish where the climax of the film is, unless the second and third act deliberately sit as the climax."
1.0,vertigo,This film definately requires two viewings to realise just how beautiful and yet freightening it is. the movie itself is meant to obssess us and oh how fun and scary it is to be obsessed with vertigo

0.0,vertigo,"Oh god, is this movie ever overrated."
1.0,vertigo,I'm speechless. Speechless. I have no speech.
1.0,vertigo,"How does Hitchcock so seamlessly blend an engrossing, sly mystery/thriller with a portrait of a man's degeneratively obsessive tendencies? We can only marvel at the master's direction."
1.0,vertigo,There aren't enough stars

1.0,vertigo,A Hitchcock masterpiece and one of James Stewart's very best and interesting performances. Never fails to fascinate. An examination of obsession and identity. Frequently tops my all-time favourite films list.
1.0,vertigo,I absolutely love this one. Jimmy Stewart was definitely cheated out of an Oscar for this role. Hitchcock is amazing (as usual). :)
1.0,vertigo,Jimmy Stewart is the man.
1.0,vertigo,Another Hitchcock masterpiece.
1.0,vertigo,"The mid to late 1950s were Hitchcock's best years, and Vertigo is no exception. Kim Novak and Jimmy Stewart are excellent and San Francisco has never looked better."
1.0,vertigo,"Same review as Rear Window, only more so."
1.0,vertigo,A Hitchcock masterpiece.
1.0,vertigo,"Another Hitchcock classic. Stewart gives off one of his best roles as a man who, aptly, suffers from vertigo. However, it is also the audience who suffers from dizziness and confusion due to the legendary director's clever plot and visual mastery. A superb picture. Highly recommended!"
1.0,vertigo,Probably Hitchcock's best film. Debatable. Its one hell of a thriller.
1.0,vertigo,"The only Hitchcock film I've seen that I really loke, or in this case love!"

1.0,vertigo,Novak. See David Thomson's BDoF.
1.0,vertigo,Hitchcock's finest most beautiful moment. A genuine masterpiece and an all-time classic.
1.0,vertigo,"If the Mona Lisa is proof that colors are capable of creating blinding beauty, Vertigo is proof that the eye of a lens is just as able, the prose of human speech just as delicious as an authentic Chinese Cuisine and a man behind a machine is as dangerous as a man with a pen or brush."
1.0,vertigo,Chilling to the bone. Absolutely one of Hitchcock's best (and one of Jimmy Stewart's). Completely mesmerizing O___O
0.0,vertigo,can't believe i actually watched this movie

1.0,vertigo,"Despite its age, Vertigo is startlingly unpredictable, gripping, mesmerizing and heartbreaking."

1.0,vertigo,Arguably Hitchcock's most personal film and one of the greatest love stories ever told.
1.0,vertigo,Classic Hitchcock for the same reasons as The Birds and North by North-West: gold class acting and subtle build-up plus Vertigo is more clever and perplexing than his other films. This is a top five Hitchcock movie.

1.0,vertigo,The disturbing and haunting masterpiece from Alfred Hitchcock.
1.0,vertigo,"It's this movie's honesty and humanity that make it so creepy.

1.0,vertigo,"I had slight vertigo in high places as a kid, so this movie scared me on different levels."

1.0,vertigo,"If, by the end of this movie, you look on the ground and there isn't a puddle of piss and drool, there's something wrong with you.

1.0,vertigo,Hitchcock's Magnum Opus
1.0,rashomon,A directorial masterpiece about perception which has gone on to be named in academia for the interpretations of events.
0.0,rashomon,"Tiny pearl, overpowering melodrama."
1.0,rashomon,Akira Kurosawa brilliantly portrays how an incident can be told as many different stories from different point of views and none of them coincides with the real truth which is yet unknown even after the movie finishes.
1.0,rashomon,Brilliantly crafted film with a groundbreaking narrative structure and eye opening direction by Akira Kurosawa. Simple yet brilliant set design and beautiful camera technique that changed the medium forever.
1.0,rashomon,"Not just technically brilliant, but an intriguing mystery where the truth doesn't matter as much as the characters within it."
1.0,rashomon,"An influence to cinema lovers, Rashomon changed the foreign film business"
1.0,rashomon,Kurosawa sure knows how to tell a story.
0.0,rashomon,I was unfortunately bored out of my mind.
1.0,rashomon,"Rating a classic like this is obviously foolish. Rashomon reminds us that truth is more than facts in the outer world, but what is going on in our own inner worlds."
1.0,rashomon,"Kurosawa's best. A surprising commentary that still seems to reflect even the most modern of times. He provides the story with challenging perspectives, true levels of character flaws, and blind judgment. What we get is a film most human."
1.0,rashomon,"Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece has become a copied plot-line since its release. The ""same story from many perspectives"" is standardized here for subsequent generations to repeat over and over.The film is an excellent tale, and despite it being Japanese, is still quite satisfying to watch."
1.0,rashomon,"This is my best ever life changing film. This is about you looking at the truth in the eye and still wonder if it's a ""FACT""."
1.0,rashomon,"Haunting, beautiful tale of ego, perspective and humanity's flaws. A classic."
1.0,rashomon,"A dark, silent, effective drama flick with you as a character, Kurosawa captivates quickly with his brilliant mind and effective symbolism. I have not and surely will not ever see a movie quite so well themed as Rashomon."
1.0,rashomon,Three witnesses offer conflicting accounts of the same crime and only manage to prove how unreliable people are. 5 bursts of hysterical laughter /5
1.0,rashomon,"Restaurado pela fundação do Scorsese, vi um dos filmes que mais explodiram minha cabeça, hoje na Mostra..."
1.0,rashomon,Perfect. Satisfyingly thrilling/disturbing and profound. Kept me on the edge of my seat.
1.0,rashomon,So who is telling the truth? And what is truth?
0.0,rashomon,i like Toshiro Mifune but the movie is boring
1.0,rashomon,The cinematography is out of this world. Every shot is beautiful and the acting is wonderful.
1.0,rashomon,How many times does Mifune laugh in this one? Either way a must see.
1.0,rashomon,Every single part is perfect. It is perfect.
1.0,rashomon,"Brilliant masterpiece. The cinematography, composition and acting are nearly unsurpassed in cinema."
1.0,rashomon,"An inspirational masterpiece. It's brilliant. If you haven't seen it yet, I URGE you to."
1.0,rashomon,"Whoa! Theatrical and intellectual and still emotionally engaging. A film that has me thinking about it, and talking about it for a long time afterwards. And a films I will want to see again."
1.0,rashomon,"A gripping whodunit all the way through, this film makes you question human goodness vs selfish motivations and ultimately, reality."
1.0,rashomon,"Perfect, even better than Seven Samurai."
1.0,rashomon,"Groundbreaking narrative and moral elements, stylish camera wizardry and challenging discussions of right and wrong abound, Rashomon is a challenging classic."
1.0,rashomon,Nothing short of fantastic
1.0,rashomon,"""Rashomon"" is one of cinema's most profound films. Its insights continue to haunt me. H. W. Zegers"

1.0,rashomon,"The subjective nature of truth is at the heart of this poetic film about the seduction of a woman, the death of her husband, the bandit who confesses, & the woodsman who witnesses it all. A powerful film that everyone should watch at least once."

1.0,rashomon,Was captured by the story and the twisted truth.
1.0,rashomon,"Completely innovative, and mainly a masterpiece, both on screen, and behind the camera. It's brilliantly acted, written, and directed, and proves that not all movies have to be films. Some can be metaphors."

1.0,rashomon,Behind 'Seven Samurai' as Kurosawa's best.
1.0,rashomon,Epitome of story telling.

1.0,rashomon,"Primeiro filme de Kurosawa que eu assisti. Uma verdadeira aula de jornalismo: nÃ£o existe verdade absoluta e sim versÃµes da verdade e bons argumentos, ou maus."
1.0,rashomon,One of my top 10 films of all time. Great insight into the human psyche and astounding performances from Kurosawa's band of unknowns.
1.0,rashomon,:O TRUTH - What is it???
0.0,rashomon,"maybe significant, but a chore to watch"
1.0,rashomon,It's Rashomon. Rashomon.

1.0,rashomon,"100% Yes, it's that good."
1.0,rashomon,Rashomon was a very interesting movie and surpirsed me that they were able to make come from five different points of views. This was also other master piece by Akira Kurosawa.
1.0,rashomon,One of my favorite Kurosawa movies and an exercise on truth. Beautiful photography.
1.0,rashomon,"Friggin Masterpiece. A murder drama done well to exploit the highs and lows of humanity. painfully misogynistic, but so were those times."
1.0,rashomon,"I can sit here and talk about a film's writing, or character development, or editing and cinematography and just go on a giant spiel, when I could really just say four words. I loved this movie!"
1.0,rashomon,Would have to say that this is my favorite of Kurosawa's.
1.0,rashomon,Another excellent example of Kurosawa's art -- A master of the Cinema working in top form.
1.0,rashomon,"I don't need to write a review of this. I've been so taken with this film I've watched it 5 times over the course of the week. I've been dumbfounded to find that students in one of my film classes found it boring, slow, and melodramatic."
1.0,rashomon,"i thought this movie was really planned out and a great success. i don't think there was one specific genre. because i did laugh, but there were dramatic parts as well. great movie."
1.0,rashomon,"See the 2008 restored version, as it just looks and sounds incredible. If you have never seen Rashomon, then there's so much to learn about film narative, film technique, and film history. Kurosawa's first (of many) true masterpieces, and every time you watch it, you will see it differently."
1.0,rashomon,Everyone's got a reason to lie........this gets better every time I see it.
1.0,rashomon,"Ho. Ly. Fuck. This movie is truly incredible. The way in which Kurosawa approaches the topic of reality as being entirely subjective is incredible. While people have copied many of the ideas in this film, if you look at it in terms of the time it was truly revolutionary. What a movie."
1.0,rashomon,The key to a Japanese woman heart if you don't want to know what is Bunraku.
1.0,rashomon,Rewatching this for the first time in many years. Timeless. Fucking. Classic.
0.0,rashomon,Watched it on TCM with Bill Hader's guest commentary. Splendour in form.
1.0,rashomon,"What's so good about this movie? It hasn't aged, it's simple yet striking. (struck me completely), we all know we are subjective, but to what level does subjectivity affect our views? Found this movie so profound. Simply brilliant."
1.0,rashomon,"An intriguing story, fantastic acting, and expert directing combine to form another classic from Kurosawa, delivering an indepth look at the idea of truth and the purpose of life and its trials."
1.0,rashomon,"I think this is actually better than seven samurai (there, I said it). more style, more seriousness, more heart, and more thought, I cannot understand why this isn't regarded as Kurosawa's greatest achievement."
1.0,rashomon,"This was my first Kurosawa movie ever. I saw it way back in middle school, and it started my love affair with his films. Almost a ""who dun it?"" that talks about the human condition, if you haven't seen this film go watch it. If you have, go watch it again. your view of it might change."
1.0,rashomon,Kurosawa Japan best. Big-time movie! Yes?
1.0,rashomon,A powerful look at subjectivity.
1.0,rashomon,"Sure, it's not packed with tons of action, but it's very emotional, very suspenseful, and very simple in its presentation which adds an extra element of elegance and sophistication; all with an ending that makes you reflect on your own selfishness. The symbolism and metaphors were tops."
1.0,rashomon,A true masterpiece in all aspects..with unheard of use of camera nddynamic lighting..akira kurosawa's classic is a feast even today..the presentation of story..suspense merged with courtroom drama..inspired countless movies nd has left a legacy.. a must watch for all movie lovers...
1.0,rashomon,One of my favorites.
1.0,rashomon,"Excelent, one of the best movies by Kurosava , I saw it for first time when I was 8 since that time i saw I couple of times and still amazes me..."
1.0,rashomon,"Blew me away. Akira Kurosawa towers above most other directors in the 20th century and this is no exception. Rashomon is leagues above all other films in the 50's, equaled only by Kurosawa's other classics."
1.0,rashomon,"Not just a masterpiece, it's practically part of the periodic table of cinema."
1.0,rashomon,"My Rating: 95% .  Beautiful, Haunting, Surreal and Bittersweet. Rashomon is a film that is spot on and very true."
1.0,rashomon,"If you've never seen a film by Akira Kurosawa, this is a good start. He also made Throne of Blood, a samurai Macbeth and Ran, based on Shakespeare's King Lear."
1.0,rashomon,Akira's best work! So many filmmakers have tried to capture the essence of this film. Nothing beats the original.
1.0,rashomon,"Fascinating, influential drama which despite its age still has the power to provoke and astonish."
1.0,rashomon,"An exquisitely rendered representation of perception, human brokenness, and the hopeless bravely hoping despite these odds."
1.0,rashomon,"Kurosawa's best...Employs a multi-flashback recounting the same incident, as a plot device.. 60 years on and filmmakers all over the world still get inspired by this classic!!!"
1.0,rashomon,"A timeless masterpiece in world cinema.....and I feel Toshiro Mifune, as Tajomaru the bandit, does a better ""Raavan"" act than Abhishek Bachchan as Beera...."
1.0,rashomon,A brilliant movie that has been poorly copied many times since its release.
1.0,rashomon,"This movie leads a new form of narrative and photography. Great scenario: the gate of the city, the rain... Marvelous!"
1.0,rashomon,"MystÃ©rieux, d'une modernitÃ© sans Ã©gale et incroyablement prenant. Toshiro Mifune est dÃ©ment."
1.0,rashomon,"""I don't mind a lie, so long as it's interesting,"" says the cynic. Another way to look at it is that everything is true, that the stories don't fit because of what others overlooked in their pride."
0.0,rashomon,"The music in the movie was horrible. The whole thing is black and white, which is terrible. Some of the acting was terribly overacted. The fight scenes were fakey.On top of that, it's a horribly disgusting story.Yep, terrible and horrible describe it best."
1.0,rashomon,"An impressive foreign film that leaves you guessing to the very end. Visually stunning, and so poetic even Shakespeare would have been proud. One of my new favorite films, if you know what a good movie can be without CGI or a big budget, definitely see this film."
1.0,rashomon,"In league with Ikiru, its full of sorrow and mystery."
1.0,rashomon,"It is a testament to Akira Kurosawa that he can get away with risking everything making such an original movie as this. You must remember, in 1950, Rashomon was unheard of."
1.0,rashomon,a Kurosawa Akira film
1.0,rashomon,"Even though it's now coming on sixty years old, Rashomon hasnt aged a day. With its new state of the art digital restoration its never been a better time to catch this masterpiece."
1.0,rashomon,One of the all time great films . A definite must see!
1.0,rashomon,One of the best films ever made.
1.0,rashomon,"My all time favorite movie. A fantastic study of human nature, egotism, and our propensity to lie. Add in Kurosawa's amazing cinematography and you have one of the greatest films of all time."
1.0,rashomon,Fucking great picture
1.0,rashomon,Classic samurai drama.
1.0,rashomon,"Genial pelÃ­cula, rupturista y con una gran profundidad, sobre todo en cuanto a la naturaleza humana y la subjetividad. Un maestro Kurosawa."
1.0,rashomon,One of Kurosawa's best and one of the most influential films of all time. Toshiro Mifune gives another great performance as do the rest of the cast.
1.0,rashomon,Cinema at its best & the proof of Kurosawa's cinematic genius... An awesome plot & brilliant direction. Watch it just for the sheer pleasure that spectacular cinema can bring to u...Toshiro Mifune rocks!!!
1.0,rashomon,I agree that this is one of the top foreign films of the 20th century.
1.0,rashomon,"Story telling at its absolut best. 4 different versions of the truth. A rape, and a murder in the woods. Each version is an interesting look. It may not be Kurosawa's best but its a great film and had arguably the biggest impact in america of all japanese cinema."
1.0,rashomon,"The film is much less formally daring than its literary source, but its virtues are still plentiful: Kurosawa's visual style at its most muscular, rhythmically nuanced editing, and excellent performances"
1.0,rashomon,"Ver estas pelÃ­culas es como leer un poema, es puro arte. Ya quiero ver los Siete Samurais."
1.0,rashomon,Excellent film that really makes you think!
1.0,rashomon,uncut original version only...criterion for example!
1.0,rashomon,It is Akira Kurosawa do I really need to explain why this is an amazing film?
1.0,rashomon,Even those who aren't into Japanese film will enjoy this elegant masterpiece by Kurosawa. A crime is recounted from several conflicting points of view. Which is the truth? All and none. Reality lies between the stories.
1.0,rashomon,"Kurosawa's best. Can you ever trust anyone's memory, or yours?"
1.0,rashomon,My personal favorite of Kurosawa's works.
1.0,rashomon,"A classic. A story told from 4 different viewpoints. Great cinematography, performances, and dialogue."
1.0,rashomon,if u ask for most influential movie of previous century then rashamon will certainly get a thought.
1.0,rashomon,"Zapravo je odlican film. Odlican je i predlozak po kojem je napisan scenarij. Mislio sam mu dat manje jer ipak gluma nije tako uvjerljiva na zapadnjacki nacin, ali ipak sam na vrijeme odustao od te ideje. Film, naravno, izgleda prekrasno."
1.0,rashomon,"A really simple film with the same story told from different perspectives. I have seen this done in numerous films since, but none have been able to do it this well. The story was gripping, and working out the truth was impossible. Brilliant."
1.0,rashomon,Amazing.That's all. Amazing. See it.
1.0,rashomon,Storytelling doesn't get any better than this. Kurosawa's 'Rashomon' is a master in making the viewer question the truth. The character recaps are told through much creativeness.
1.0,rashomon,"So far, out of the handful of Kurosawa films I've seen, I might say that Rashomon is his most aesthetically pleasing film."
1.0,rashomon,"The villain. The bride. The deceased. The woodcutter. All with a story to tell, the ending no different in each case: a man dies, with the circumstances being lost to bias. \"
1.0,rashomon,Rashomon (1950) is still considered to be a puzzle/ a gimmick ... Explorers deeply the human psyche and IT SHOULD NOT BE MISSED !!
1.0,rashomon,"Thoughtful mediation on perception versus reality using a (then revolutionary) structure that's been tried many times since but ever bested. It's a masterfully made, nearly perfect film, with great sequences and terrific acting (even if Mifune's performance is too big)."
1.0,rashomon,"Good adaptation of 2 of Akutagawa Ryunosuke's short stories, Rashomon and In a Bamboo Grove. A must-read book and must-see movie. Maybe Toshiro Mifune's most aclaimed performance, along with Shichinin no Samurai."
1.0,rashomon,A masterpiece. The 2008 restored version is a must see!
1.0,rashomon,"A very deep film about morality, truth, the ugly side of human nature and eventually hope. Though some may think that Toshiro Mifune overacted his performance I thought it work well for the movie."
1.0,rashomon,Brilliant considering its time
1.0,rashomon,"One of the best Movies ever made, an amazing amusing Movie with great Actors about a Story who was telled by different Persons and they are according different again amazing from how much Views a Picture can be watched"
1.0,rashomon,[2009.07.31 on DVD] Absolutely Masterpiece!!
1.0,rashomon,The film that introduced Kurosawa to the west after the war. Mifune & Shimura are fantastic.
1.0,rashomon,A masterwork of nonlinear narrative.
1.0,rashomon,"Two guys sitting in the rain. There was 3 different version of a story of the same event. It was more about the selfishness and oppurtunistic nature of man. The monk almost loose hope towards humanity, yet a little shade of kindness in the end gave him back the hope he almost lost."
1.0,rashomon,"An insanely clever classic that keeps you guessing throughout the film. The story is told brilliantly from many different angles, ending with a logical conclusion."
1.0,rashomon,i wish I could give it more stars
1.0,rashomon,Perhaps the most ripped off story of the last 50 years. OF course that describes much of Kurasowa's canon. One of the greatest films from one of cinema's greatest directors.
0.0,rashomon,"Well, I was bored to tears. Apparently it's by some director who is supposed to be a genius and everyone is ripping off him, but if that were true - I wouldn't have enjoyed a movie ever. It's old, but that's no excuse for boring me to tears."

1.0,rashomon,My favorite movie of all time!!!! Five Stars is not enough.
1.0,rashomon,"A must-see. A storyline like nothing the west has ever done before, yet very westernized in the approach. A surprisingly taboo subject for the 1950's, a creepy ""medium,"" and a shocking ending that threw me for a loop. I couldn't understand how someone could possibly not enjoy this movie."
1.0,rashomon,Parang senate inquiry sa sex scandal!
1.0,rashomon,This doesn't quite top Throne of Blood as my favorite Kurosawa movie but it gets close. Really really close.
1.0,rashomon,"A beautiful inquisition into the nature of truth, hidden beneath a simple crime drama."
1.0,rashomon,A perfect movie from one of the world's greatest directors. And the rain! How cleansing!!
1.0,rashomon,"ã?¾ã??çµ?æ§?é?¢ç?½ã??ã?¨æ??ã??ã??ã??a good combo of rashomon and in a grove, as if those stories were ever meant to be combined. anyone who ventures to kyoto might want to check out sanmon if they want the feel for the movie."
1.0,rashomon,"Ah, now this one I can get into! Need to watch it again so I can write a more detailed review, but the idea behind it is great, and it had some parts that really floored me."
1.0,rashomon,The third best Kurosawa film.
0.0,rashomon,I missed the plot and pretty much all the other things in this film because I was too busy trying to stay awake..
1.0,rashomon,"A masterpeice of cinema, by Kurisawa. Toshiro Mufuni highlights this macabre tale of a crime as seen from several diferent points of view. Later inspired numerous films including Hero, and Vantage Point."
1.0,rashomon,"Dates amazingly well, the only 'distance' comes from culture and a theatrical style. As beautifully filmed, absorbing and thought provoking as its reputation."
1.0,rashomon,A classic piece of film.
1.0,rashomon,AWESOME AWESOME a great piece of art.
1.0,rashomon,Classic...Brilliant...

1.0,rashomon,This is a perfect movie.
1.0,rashomon,Classic murder mystery.
1.0,rashomon,"Ispirato a due racconti di Akunagawa, il film ha aperto una vera e propria stagione di scoperta del cinema orientale in Italia. Ancora oggi la visione Ã¨ godibile e rappresenta una sfida all'intelligenza e sensibilitÃ  di ogni spettatore! Le riprese della foresta sono indimenticabili."
1.0,rashomon,"I feel like this movie will influence me as a filmmaker a great deal. It really is a film for filmmakers, and covers some deep philosophical ground. I still think Ikiru is his best film, but this movie is still great."
1.0,rashomon,"Excellent movie... if you love movies, you have to see this. Great story, great directing, great everything. 'Truth' is a relative term when several different accounts of the same crime are not only different, but also logically incompatible."
1.0,rashomon,One of Kurosawa's early classic's where so many Directors have copied from. It will not be everyone's cup of tea it is what it is and it is one of Kurosawa's best.
1.0,rashomon,the best story all the time
1.0,rashomon,"There's a reason why Kurosawa got an Oscar for this film. A true journey into human nature and desires, it ends up that the lies told are worse than the actual crime. Absolutely brilliant."
1.0,rashomon,"The best of Kurosawa, and a great story told with passion and great images."
1.0,rashomon,"some very beautiful images in this, and the story itself left me with a great deal to think about. I also really liked the overacting, surprisingly."

1.0,rashomon,"One of the best films ever made. Peircing examination of the unreliable narrator and spot on with cast, visuals and all else. It is my happy wish that everyone gets to see this movie at least once, it is just a real treat."
1.0,rashomon,"It's a brilliantly complicated piece of work that offers no clear answers, forcing the viewers to make up their own mind as to what it was that happened based on the self-serving testimony of the 4 people involved in the horrific incident in the woods."
1.0,rashomon,"After watching this movie, I still find myself asking what happened in those woods. If you learn anything, it's the complexity of the truth, memory, and human motive."
1.0,rashomon,"Brilliant directing by Akira Kurosawa! Wonderful story that brings up points of human nature, lies, and especially the powerful affect women have on men. Beautiful, and extremely symbolic. A must-see for hard-core movie lovers."

1.0,la_la_land,La La Land is a movie that is built perfectly to get you to feel what it feels. The choreography and music is beautiful and loud when it needs to be and quiet and subtle when it wants to be. You are pulled through a story of emotion and love and the ending leaves you wanting more.

1.0,la_la_land,Amazing coming-of-age musical that combines modern elements of pop culture with nostalgic references to the past. The music alone will leave you humming for a long time.
0.0,la_la_land,Optimistic drivel. Only wealthy people can dream about dreaming about pursuing personal passions. Artistically fun.
0.0,la_la_land,"horrible story....Emma Stone can do better, she is doing poorly in this movie."
0.0,la_la_land,"Underwhelming and sadly unimaginative. Lacking in punch and enthusiasm. Missing the ""Wow"" factor that I've come to expect from musicals that have found critical acclaim and awards in the past."
0.0,la_la_land,"This movie was incoherent. The lead actors can barely dance or sing, and every scene felt like Ryan Gosling mansplaining jazz."
1.0,la_la_land,"I was sold and enamored with this movie after the first highway scene. Good pace, witty dialogue, great music and dance. It's just amazingly fun movie, and sure to put a smile on your face."
1.0,la_la_land,"great Movie, a classic masterpiece !"
1.0,la_la_land,"One of the best movie musicals EVER (OK, not THE best, but easily top 10 and probably top 5). How could you NOT love Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling?"
1.0,la_la_land,Movie was fun and entertaining but the last 10 mins were not what I expected and I wished they had been different.

0.0,la_la_land,"Wow, that was the worst movie I have seen in the past few years. I am embarrassed for the bad acting, horrible singing, clumsy dance moves, and shitty camera work. Watch Jasujuro Ozu to learn about color. What a flop."

1.0,la_la_land,"The most exceptional film of 2016. The music, the screenplay, the direction, the cast......It's a perfect film."
0.0,la_la_land,One of the worst movies I've seen. I don't even understand how it got all those awards and nominations. The acting is stilted and cardboardy. The story is trite and the ending is terrible. The actors can't even sing and this is supposed to be a musical!

1.0,la_la_land,"Let me say I am not usually a fan of musicals, but I love this movie. It's a perfect balance between reality and fantasy and it's incredible how a lot of things said in the beginning come back and connect in the end. As Sebastian says, ""it's conflict and compromise."""
1.0,la_la_land,"A wonderful piece of perfection. Sure it did not do as much for humanity as Moonlight, Hidden Figures, etc. But it perfects it's genre and deviates from the norm with its wonderful ending which I wont give away here."
1.0,la_la_land,Best Movie of the Year.
0.0,la_la_land,This movie was so cheesy I fail to see why people liked it.
0.0,la_la_land,Musicals like this just dont work in this day and age. It feels unnatural and forced the way the songs are incorporated. At least with Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly you had panache and grace in their movements.
1.0,la_la_land,I'm not generally a fan of musicals but I got completely absorbed in this story.
1.0,la_la_land,Odiosaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
0.0,la_la_land,"Borderline boring! If Hollywood want to bring back the musical, they'll have to work a lot harder. The marketing for this movie was greater than the movie itself."

0.0,la_la_land,So bad I could not finish it.
1.0,la_la_land,Probably my new favorite movie of all time. Excellent character arcs and acting elevate an already fantastic script to new levels. The musical numbers flow with the screenplay and are not at all forcedor out of place. Damian Chazelle is a pure genius.

0.0,last_picture_show,"Typical McMurtry prententious dribble. It seems as if he wanted to write a dirty story and decided to have it take place in a small Texas town, just to make it provocative - a story without a story that exists only to exist. Not nearly worth the hype."
1.0,last_picture_show,"Really good movie about kids in a small town and the romantic struggles they endure. Cybill Shepherd plays the role of the spoiled vixen perfectly. Bogdanovich does an excellent job. It's a rare movie that creates the feeling of loss, hardship, and longing. Amazing stuff."

1.0,last_picture_show,"The Last Picture Show is basically a Norman Rockwell painting of a Shakespearean tragedy with the word ""smoldering"" placed somewhere in there. If you can't relate to this movie in some way, if some part of it doesn't reflect some aspect of your life, you are probably not human."
1.0,last_picture_show,"An exciting piece of 70's cinema. Despite taking place in the 1950's this film feels timeless. The relationships are raw, sexy, frustrating, and human. Mistakes are made, lovers become entangled with other lovers. What a beautiful web that Bogdanovich weaves."

1.0,last_picture_show,probally one of the greatest coming of age movies ever
1.0,last_picture_show,"An excellent coming-of-age film that captures the small-town postwar vibe of Amarene, Texas (actually, Archer City). Bogdanovich directs a dream-team cast."

1.0,last_picture_show,Masterpiece in every sense of the word!

1.0,last_picture_show,One of the best American films of the 70's.
1.0,last_picture_show,"Great acting (especially by Bridges). Black and white at first seems a little strange, but fits the movie perfectly, reflecting the desolate, almost ghost town they live in. The ending takes a while to understand the meaning of, but it still ranks as one of the best movies I've ever seen."
1.0,last_picture_show,I love how they gave it the 1950s feel.
1.0,last_picture_show,A extremely potent film about the ending of adolesence and the difficulties that go along with it. This film touched me like no other film has touched me. I love this film. Could there have been a more wonderful last picture show than Red River? Bogdanovich is brilliant.
1.0,last_picture_show,This movie has some of the best ensemble acting I've ever seen! All the characters are three-dimensional and very true to life.
1.0,last_picture_show,"This movie is SO true to life in Texas. It's depressing, especially when you realise that these characters and town are based off of real life!"
1.0,last_picture_show,A classic. And Timothy Bottoms is hot.

1.0,last_picture_show,This is one of the greatest movies in the world

1.0,last_picture_show,"Heartbreaking and tragic; Bogdanovich crafts a phenomenal film of substance, character and thematic sadness."
1.0,last_picture_show,One of the great films of all time--a bleak and sad loss-of-innocence story with rich characters and great acting. Wonderfully dreary b&w; photography. Why did director Bogdanovich's career collapse??
1.0,last_picture_show,Absolutely amazing and memorable. Bottoms nails what I believe is a very hard role. The film makes you justify grey subject matter in black-and-white. It's an homage to other movies which never could have shown what this movie does.
1.0,last_picture_show,"Set in the 50s, but a timeless story of the loss of childhood naivete."

1.0,last_picture_show,"in my top 2 or 3, there is nothing wrong with this movie. it actually looks like it was made in the era it is set in. I dont know how bogdanovich did it, especially considering most of his other work. (actually it was because of his then wife Polly Platt who should have been a director)"
1.0,last_picture_show,This is the last word on dying American towns. It is also beautifully filmed.
1.0,last_picture_show,Absolutely fantastic. One of my favorite movies ever. You can literaly feel this town dying.

1.0,last_picture_show,The best character movie I've seen. Reminds me a lot of American Beauty.
1.0,last_picture_show,A stark black-and-white drama about a fading small texas town in the 1950s....Perhaps director Peter Bogdanovich's finest hour second only to the more sugar coated Paper Moon. The most mournful of all youth films.
1.0,last_picture_show,"This move is a school in honest filmmaking. It's slow pace help construct a world so real, so engaging that I couldn't stop watching."
1.0,last_picture_show,a cinematic masterpiece coming of age story adapted from the book by larry mcmurtry

1.0,last_picture_show,The book is even better.

1.0,last_picture_show,this is such a good movie. its raelly depressing. its about kids who feel hhopeless. the football team cant do anything. there is a lot of symbolism. the main boy gets made fun of a lot. no ones going anywhere. the movie theater is a symbol too.

1.0,last_picture_show,Stunning performances from such young actors. McMurtry's novel loses none of it's beauty on screen.

1.0,mr_turner,great insight to the British painter
0.0,mr_turner,I could not even make it 15 minutes into this before turning it off. I could not handle the horrible and almost incoherent accents of everyone. This might be a great movie...but I will never know because I just don't care.
1.0,mr_turner,Felt i'd stepped back in time. A beautifully made film about a fascinating man.
0.0,mr_turner,Interminably long. Frustratingly lacking in plot. 2.5 hours I won't get back.
0.0,mr_turner,Yawn. This was just excruciating monotony...Gelatiny even! I lasted 5 minutes and then left the room. I couldn't take any more of Mr. Turner's grunting gloominess. The half star is for the beautiful landscape.
0.0,mr_turner,"An excruciating slog that seems made only to mock those who see art in something made by a monkey throwing feces at a blank canvas, since J. M. W. Turner is portrayed as a repulsive, vulgar and contemptible hog and played by Spall as a ridiculous growling caricature."
1.0,mr_turner,Wonderful portrayal of the life and artistic evolution of the eccentric British painter J. M. W. Turner.
0.0,mr_turner,Like drinking a glass of plain water.
1.0,mr_turner,Positively stunning portrayed of this artistic genius in all of his flaws. Timothy Spall is a force of nature. Best seen with subtitles.
1.0,mr_turner,"Mike Leigh's masterpiece: gloriously lit and photographed, self-effacingly directed, wonderfully well-acted by a huge cast, with a transcendent central performance by Timothy Spall. A word too for Gary Yershon's plangent string score. Hugely recommended."
1.0,mr_turner,"Classic Mike Leigh and breathtakingly beautiful. A fascinating recreation of English life at the time. Sometimes brutal, sometimes funny, always captivating."
1.0,mr_turner,Mike Leigh is a god. Timothy Spall was fantastic.
1.0,mr_turner,"Just a comment. Who is the ignoramus at RT who described this film as a ""Hollywood biopic""?"
1.0,mr_turner,Mr Turner......nice little paintings.....I have seen this film at the cinema 3 times now and would long to see it again and again. The charm of this production is a very special treat to enjoy over and over......first rate job......thank you.

0.0,mr_turner,"Wow, I guess I watched a different movie than the critics. This was useless."
1.0,mr_turner,"This is how you make a biographical film. Most people will have trouble hearing the dialogue (unless British), which I think explains the disparity between critics and the audience ratings."

1.0,mr_turner,"If a Romantic painting could play out in the fourth dimension, the result would not be unlike this film. Everything your typical studio-manufactured biopic does wrong or predictably Mr. Turner does inventively or not at all."
1.0,mr_turner,"Delectable and finely crafted piece by Mike Leigh, impressive performance from Timothy Spall."
1.0,mr_turner,GAWD DAMN THIS WAS TERRIFIC
1.0,mr_turner,While munching smacks I was made aware that I was watching another Mike Leigh masterpiece and should LISTEN UP!
1.0,mr_turner,Probably the best movie I have seen and I have seen most of them.

1.0,mr_turner,"Quite a historical figure, impressive show of contemporary culture and art academy."
0.0,mr_turner,"This movie blows! I can't believe the critics on this. Seriously, I walked out after 100 minutes. I couldn't take it anymore."
0.0,mr_turner,It is very slow and hard to follow. It starts during Mr. Turner's 50s and young audiences have no emotional connection with the protagonist.
0.0,mr_turner,The only reason some critic would see five stars around this snore-fest was the he or she was knocked out with a club.
0.0,mr_turner,The worst movie i've ever seen.
0.0,mr_turner,"Plodding and painful, this film leaves you wondering why Turner painted and why we should care."
1.0,mr_turner,Outstanding acting.....
0.0,mr_turner,"A bleak, plodding, overlong, soul-sucking waste of 2-1/2 hours, with no likable characters."
0.0,mr_turner,Too long - not enough interesting dialogue or plot to keep my interest. Found his sexual desires scenes to be either gross or boring. Director/Producer could have done a much better job at crafting this story.
1.0,mr_turner,"Timothy Spall could be considered the J. M. W. Turner of modern acting as his embodiment is so raw and unprecedented. Not counting the long-winded conversations, Mr. Turner is unconventionally engrossing and a real success."
0.0,mr_turner,"Interesting, but long and boring.."
0.0,mr_turner,Can not understand the garbled dialog!!! Maybe the second half of the movie worked. Do not know - walked out - should have left 10 min into the film.

0.0,mr_turner,Worst movie that I have seen in years. The main character is disgusting and not much of anything happens with the plot.
0.0,mr_turner,This movie was like being forced to spend two and a half hours with the most disgusting man.
0.0,mr_turner,"Easily, the second most boring movie I've ever had the misfortune of seeing."
0.0,mr_turner,Absolutely the most boring film I've seen in years. I can never remember falling asleep in an theater before but I could not keep my eyes open through this one. If I wasn't sitting in the middle of a crowed row I would have walked out after the first 30min.
1.0,mr_turner,"A real ""art house"" film!!! Beautiful cinematography and an outstanding performance by Timothy Spall makes this a must see for anyone who appreciates film as art."
0.0,mr_turner,"Two and a half hours of watching a very ugly, unpleasant person do boring things. Shockingly, brutally slow, insufferably full of itself, and overall one of the worst films of the year."
0.0,mr_turner,Ugh. Boring. Great costumes though.
0.0,mr_turner,An offensive abomination glorifying disgusting people and values with every shot forced to look like an artistic Instagram picture.
0.0,mr_turner,"Acting, Period decor and architecture excellent. But the movie was weird and boring and painfully long at 2 1/2 hrs."
0.0,mr_turner,Two and one-half hours of my life I will not get back. It is LITERALLY like watching paint dry.
0.0,mr_turner,"This is the slowest, dullest movie I have seen in recent memory. If you think you'd enjoy watching a miserable, mumbling old fart putting on and taking off his coat and hat for over 2 1/2 hours, then this is the movie for you."

0.0,mr_turner,An incredibly boring film.
0.0,mr_turner,"Avoid this movie at all costs if you like Turner's paintings and want to save 2.5 hours of your life. While cinematography was great and Spall's acting a tour de force, nothing other than the slow and revolting happens in the movie."
0.0,mr_turner,"I couldn't understand most of what was said, at least for the first hour until I left. It really needed closed captioning because they were speaking a foreign language as far as I was concerned. Also, nothing happened."
0.0,mr_turner,"Very disappointing. Read the reviews and thought it would be excellent, but it was over long and full of caricatures. If it had ended after the death of Mr Turner senior, it would have been more satisfactory."

1.0,mr_turner,I am down open see the other Academy Award winner all timeclassic story never made?

0.0,mr_turner,Excruciatingly slow and boring . Couldn't watch this to completion
0.0,mr_turner,Clearly an attempt to cash in on the Downton train! A remarkably long film about a quite unremarkable life. Maybe Hayden's life would have made for a more interesting story but I guess not enough Americans will have heard of him! Thoroughly disappointed and ripped off!
0.0,mr_turner,Grotesque and goes nowhere.
1.0,mr_turner,Great film.Wonderful photography

0.0,mr_turner,Long and Boring. A waste of time.
1.0,mr_turner,"Stunning visuals, great acting from the whole cast. Interesting take in that it shows Turner as he slipped from fashion as the Victorian period came of age. He came from the era of the Prince Regent and his manners reflected this. Some may think it slow paced but this is a Mike Lee film!"
0.0,mr_turner,"Timothy Spall doesn't carry it off. The film is too slow, & far too long. Best actors are the housekeeper (??) & the mistress (Marion Bailey)."
0.0,mr_turner,"When reading the critic's reviews, I can't help but feel here is an ""emperor's new clothes"" quality to this film. The audience is right. This is a mediocre film that is interesting solely for it's period sets and costume"
0.0,mr_turner,"Not Smalls at his best, an interesting film, not a feel good film, left cinema feeling depressed, like most I would suspect, nothing to lift the film out from the gloomy ending, more humour would have helped."
1.0,mr_turner,A funny (and yet sad) portrayal of one of Britain's best artists!
0.0,mr_turner,Goodness me. How to dash every hope of a convincing narrative or story. Spall's grunting cannot save this piece from being anything other than a Frankenstien stich together of vignettes. So much potential lost by a film maker's pursuit of a blockbuster.
0.0,mr_turner,Boring and tedious - wasted almost an hour of my life and then left the cinema. Noticed a few other people snoozing on my way out. I usually like Mike Leigh films but not this one.
1.0,mr_turner,Timothy Spall is outstanding!
1.0,mr_turner,Simply outstanding - Turner wads naughty boy!

1.0,mr_turner,enjoyable biopic well acted and directed
0.0,mr_turner,This film is VERY poor. We left early after giving it 45 minutes it had NO storyline. We really wanted it to be good. We read the reviews and we really can't believe that critics gave it 95% and the audience gave it 75%.
0.0,mr_turner,"The most boring movie I ever seen. 2 hours was waiting if something going to happen. The last 20 minutes just waiting when Mr. Turner finally dies. Despite beautiful pictures, I recommend go to a museum and don't waste your time."
0.0,mr_turner,"Way too long and uninteresting for the general audience. Might be of interest to people very familiar with his paintings. I would suggest you should at least be familiar with Turners paintings before seeing the film, as the film seems to refer to them a lot."

1.0,mr_turner,"Thoroughly well made film. Photography, story, acting and settings. Well worth a view."
1.0,mr_turner,Mike Leigh at his very very best. This is scrumptious to look at and well acted. Spall is very good as are the rest of the cast. Its a film about Turner himself more that the actual art. But some scenes look like a picture. Serene. Funny in parts and well worth a watch
1.0,mr_turner,"Timothy Spall's magnificent performance is the centrepiece of Mike Leigh's film, which is as finely detailed and richly textured as a great oil painting."
1.0,taxi_driver,"Probably one of my favorite films. This movie touches on themes of isolation in a city of millions, PTSD (where do you think Travis Bickle got that army jacket with his name on it from? What war?), and the effects of crime in the big city. A classic."

1.0,taxi_driver,"Martin Scorsese's best film? Certainly his most influential, cause Quentin Tarantino and John Woo have both taking more than a few cues from this baby. The fact that it's still so unsettling in this day of no-holds-barred-blood-letting films says a lot, too."

1.0,taxi_driver,Classic ! never gets old ! 9/10
1.0,taxi_driver,This is one of if not my Favorite movie of all time. Travis Bickle can be related to on many levels.

1.0,taxi_driver,"Dark, gritty and probably for me Scorsese and De Niro's finest work together. Travis Bickle is a stunningly well rendered character and still one of De Niro's most complex and deep performances."
1.0,taxi_driver,"I finally saw this from start to finish after all these years. This is pure filmmaking, I loved almost every minute of it. Incredible performances all around even Scorsese. I do kinda wish they ended the movie right after the shootout scene, but I can see why they added that little epilogue."
1.0,taxi_driver,He makes his own hollow point bullets.

1.0,taxi_driver,"Simply put, this is one of my all-time favorite movies."
1.0,taxi_driver,This film really shows you how disgusting the world is. It also shows you that you can make a difference no matter how disgusting the world is.
1.0,taxi_driver,"My second favorite film of all time. A movie really for the lonely. Robert de Niro did a great job here. I feel like I was the main character. The scene with him watching tv with his gun in his hand and song playing "" Late for the sky"" is one of the most memorable scenes I ever saw."

1.0,taxi_driver,A brilliant film in every aspect.

1.0,taxi_driver,Nearly as good as goodfellas
1.0,taxi_driver,The film that really got me into Scorsese
1.0,taxi_driver,"A beautifully made film, with a compelling and true performance by DeNiro. Some nice night-life visuals and delicate storytelling make this film darkly funny at times but is mostly a look at the grim reality and how different individuals get affected by that. Just a masterpiece in every sense."
1.0,taxi_driver,"A magnificent character study and feature length statement. It goes from romantic drama to violent thriller, and you enjoy the ride as Travis Bickle's descent into darkness pulls you in."

1.0,taxi_driver,"What a great movie, by far Scorcese's best film."
1.0,taxi_driver,"A cinematic landmark and a masterpiece by Scorsese, but all the same, it is a brutal and nihilistic look at the dark underworld of NYC in the 1970's. Tough to watch, but very rewarding to experience."

1.0,taxi_driver,"Always, always Scorsese's best."
1.0,taxi_driver,Taxi Driver is a darkly sad and incredibly engrossing film about a alienation and morality with a mesmerizing performance by DeNiro and the perfect street grit direction of Scorsese. My only wish is that the Mohawk had a larger role in the film.
1.0,taxi_driver,Mr. Scorsese is also a film historian and educator - and it shows in every frame.
1.0,taxi_driver,"Amazing. A portrait of urban loneliness and paranoia that resonates, even after New York has largely moved beyond the crime-ridden, grimy, licentious cesspool it depicts. It forces you to confront why we we so often sympathize with vigilantes. Calling it a masterpiece is not an exaggeration."
1.0,taxi_driver,"You cannot go wrong with Taxi Driver. This is Deniro at his best. Absolutely a perfect film. It was horrifying, romantic, and mysterious. Has an incredible score and in my opinion, the greatest screenplay of all time."

1.0,taxi_driver,Taxi Driver is my all time favorite Robert De Miro film and in my top 10 favorite films list.
1.0,taxi_driver,"The lead is so complex (sometimes heinous, sometimes charming, always disturbed) and the criticisms of the Vietnam war so scathing that to refer to ""Taxi Driver"" as anything other than a masterpiece would be an inexcusable offense."

1.0,taxi_driver,Not only De Niro's greatest film but arguably Scorsese's as well. Transgressive (perhaps nihilistic) fiction hasn't been this good since Dostoevsky's Notes From The Underground. The film is a real classic and you can't claim to be a movie buff unless you've seen it.
1.0,taxi_driver,"One of the greatest films ever made. Robert De Niro gives a unforgettable performance, playing the forever alone & misunderstood Travis. No other movie puts you in the mind of a character like Taxi Driver."

1.0,taxi_driver,"What a great movie, by far Scorsese's best film."

1.0,taxi_driver,De Niro at his finest!!!!!!!!
1.0,taxi_driver,"My favorite Scorsese movie as well as my favorite De Niro flick. Everyone can relate to being lonely at some point in their life, that's why Taxi Driver hits home with so many people."
1.0,taxi_driver,"Yeah, it's a masterpiece and all that good shit."
1.0,taxi_driver,A fabulous screen play & a searing performance from Robert De Niro are just two of the reasons this is a must-see film. Perhaps director Martin Scorsese's best film and that is certainly arguable. Having said that this is one of the greatest films made.  A compelling and important film.
1.0,taxi_driver,"One of Martin Scorce's best. This is #1, Raging Bull #2, then Good Fellas."
1.0,taxi_driver,It just keeps getting more compelling everytime i watch it.
1.0,taxi_driver,"A phenominal and an unforgettable masterpiece. This is why I love Scorsese. Great performances all around, a fantastic script and just nothing short from a perfect movie."
1.0,taxi_driver,his best movie yet besides his role in godfather
1.0,taxi_driver,DeNiro played one of the most interesting characters to come along in cinema.
1.0,taxi_driver,best martin Scorsese movie by far
1.0,taxi_driver,This is by far one of the best movies of all time. Robert DeNiro plays one of the most distressed and pitiable character. Takes his date to a porno and then... wait til the last scene.
1.0,taxi_driver,"ver a betsy caminar con esa musica de bernard herman es hermoso, deniro hablando con un espejo es increible, un final fantastico, SCORSESE presento al mundo su cine perfecto, es y quedara para toda la vida como una de las mejores peliculas de todo la historia."

1.0,taxi_driver,The greatest movie ever made...
1.0,taxi_driver,"""You must be talking to me!"""
1.0,taxi_driver,"One of my favorite films ever. ""Taxi Driver"" is a very elaborate study of the human mind when isolated. It's probably the best directed film I've ever seen, with very good shots that took a lot of gall. Robert De Niro gives it his all in his best performance!"
1.0,taxi_driver,One of the greatest films known to man and it's all thanks to a brilliant performance from Robert De Niro. This is definitely a timeless classic for movie lovers.
1.0,taxi_driver,"Robert De Niro is absolutely excellent in Taxi Driver, appearing both insane, and relatable. This is one of my personal favourite movies of all-time."
1.0,taxi_driver,"De Niro's most chilling performance, as Martin Scorsese directs a man on the edge of madness."
1.0,taxi_driver,One of the best movies of the last century for sure. I love the slow burring degeneration and his burning rage against injustice in the big city. So bleak and pitch perfect.
1.0,taxi_driver,"Pretty good sequel to ""Catcher in the Rye"""
1.0,taxi_driver,One word: brilliant.
1.0,taxi_driver,No wonder this is known as the film that started Robert De Niro's career his performance is amazing one of the best drama based genre films out there.
1.0,taxi_driver,Excellent directing and beautifully crafted. One of the best De Niro's performance :)

1.0,taxi_driver,Easily my favorite film of all time.
1.0,taxi_driver,"Scorsese criou uma atmosfera sufocante e violenta, deixando a época de ouro de Hollywood para trás. De Niro retratando de forma excepcional uma alma atormentada no caos urbano da antiga Nova York."
1.0,taxi_driver,Wow! Criss que c hot!!!!
1.0,taxi_driver,Taxi Driver is dim and brooding with a hard psychologically-driven character that questions morality and brutality. Arguably Scorsese's most serious of works.

1.0,taxi_driver,A heroic De Niro performance & a thorough Scorsese directing gives you a brilliant piece that digs deep into the human nature. Best Scorsese film in my opinion.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Mastroianni es genial. Fellini relata la historia (sin historia) de la vida, la ""pasión de la vida"". La belleza inalcanzable de Sylvia, la inocencia inalcanzable de Paola. El vacío del mundo modernos; la esperanza del calor familar de Steiner."

1.0,dolce_vita,"Much like its contemporary, L'Avventura, La Dolve Vita perfectly captures the ennui and amoral listlessness of the idle rich. Fellini is captivating at his best."
1.0,dolce_vita,"It feels immense, but at the end of the day this is simply about a scared and insecure man's efforts to project false confidence. He keeps his eyes locked on what he believes will satisfy him, only to find that all paths have trials."
0.0,dolce_vita,The most pretentious movie I have ever seen in my life.
1.0,dolce_vita,"A pretty grim and oddly surreal look at the emptiness of wealth and hedonism. Fellini is great as usual here, and I can't help feeling it is a major influence on one of my favorite films, The Great Beauty."
1.0,dolce_vita,A crítica de Fellini ao modo de viver da burguesia italiana no pós-Guerra é duro e claro. E as inovações narrativas só se enriquecem com a fotografia e os figurinos espetaculares.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Fellini brings you to a place which is physically impossible, and he creates this with characters you either love or hate, but you feel from them. The most fun I have ever had in one film in my entire life"

1.0,dolce_vita,La dolce vita [1960]
1.0,dolce_vita,Here is a remarkable creation. I have never come away from a movie feeling so simultaneously fulfilled yet empty. It refracts then reflects the viewers' emotional extremes back onto them in ever-changing ways.
1.0,dolce_vita,"La Dolce Vita portrays blissful ignorance as the truth of tragedy. Elegant and suggestive cinematography, some of Fellini's greatest ideas, and a length not ever overblown or tiresome. La Dolce Vita is definitely an Italian masterpiece."

1.0,dolce_vita,"Can't believe I went this long without seeing it, but there are a few I still haven't seen. It pretty much speaks for itself, but I'm left with the question that if the paparazzi world was this decadent in the 60s, what would Fellini make of it today?"
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini's masterful and stunning portrayal of Italian neo-realism is among his best work. No-one can pull off the classic fountain scene like Anita Ekberg.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Beautiful portrait of decadent disillusionment. Endlessly gratifying visuals, and great performances by all. Touching, sad, heartbreaking, yet exciting, and deeply satisfying, if cynical. Fellini's visions of humanity, and the intricate glories of Rome, and Nico. A great big slice of story."

1.0,dolce_vita,The most realistically debauched film ever
1.0,dolce_vita,"I have no idea what this film is about, the symbolism of the sea monster in the ending, the g-rated orgy. Maybe it documents the emergence of the paparazzi or the decline of western civilization. The absurd, the absurd. Very postmodern Rome, Very Fellini."

1.0,dolce_vita,can you believe there are only 12 flixster reviews of this movie?
1.0,dolce_vita,"A more miserable life is better, believe me, than an existence protected by an organized society where everything is calculated, everything is perfect."
1.0,dolce_vita,"Pure Fellini absurdism. The way it was chalked up I was expecting more of the gorgeous Anita Ekberg, but Mastroianni is very magnetic in the film. I was shocked by how beautiful this film was (add another point to bw being more beautiful than color)."
1.0,dolce_vita,Amazing. Everything about this film is right. I love the sense of endless chase. I'm depressed I'll never again get to watch this movie for the first time.

0.0,dolce_vita,So long. Full of Italian-speak. Surreal imagry that I couldn't figure out. I gave up 2 hours into it. Sorry Fellini. I'd rather take 8 1/2.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Large, satisfying, mysterious."
0.0,dolce_vita,Technically a very good film but far too tedious for me
1.0,dolce_vita,This movie exhibits the manifestation of decadence. It is both quiet and powerful; Fellini's best.
1.0,dolce_vita,"As I had said about Persona, this is one of the few films which I think is perfect. After watching this, I felt like I had just experienced life, hence the title of the movie. The cinematography is enchanting, the acting was as well, and everything about this film was perfect."

1.0,dolce_vita,i thought it was wonderful.
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini is a genius. All eight sequences in this movie stand on their own. The idea that modernism will change man is a fascinating one. This movie seriously changed the way I view movies.
1.0,dolce_vita,It makes it's point so well and so often(too much of a good thing is a bad thing; the disillusionment that comes with excessive decadence.)that it nearly folds over on itself and becomes an example of it's own meaning.
1.0,dolce_vita,"I absolutely love Fellini: Italy, pagentry, blasphemy, sexuality on a grand scale. He is absolutely brilliant and never fails to amuse me. Nino Rotta and the accompanying music is amazing!"

1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini's masterpiece paved the way for movies like Lost in Translation by trading typical narrative structure for everyday examination.
1.0,dolce_vita,"This is the first Fellini film I ever saw, and at the time I found it truly astonishing. For me, it was a great introduction to Fellini's world and made me want to see explore his other films. I see it as a sublime European pop epic that needs to be viewed again and again..."

1.0,dolce_vita,"i liked this more than eight and a half. i don't think it is as daring or visually stimulating, but i had a much better time taking it in. it's three hours of chaos but the scenes are short and clever. and unline the other fellini film i feel like this one had more of a pulse."

1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini...need I say more?
1.0,dolce_vita,Images from this movie never quite leave me. Leave it to Fellini to break the narrative format and create something this incredible. It's the first true character piece but with an epic scope of rome. Fellini could say so much with so little. Gets better every time I see it.
1.0,dolce_vita,"This movie is one of my favorites. The movie was just great, I first saw it in my Italian Cinema class and was completely blown away. Great film."

1.0,dolce_vita,"whenever I am down, i always think about this movie. It shows that not even in film you get everything you want. Some time we as humans expect everything to come so easily but in reality that doesn't always happens. Fellini is such a master and I will always look up to him."

1.0,dolce_vita,The party scene where Anouk Aimee sits Snaporaz down in the lonely room and talks to him via vents...Dat scene is pretty much OFF DA HOOK.
1.0,dolce_vita,Amazingly ahead of its time--it's hard to believe this was shot in 1959. Still shocking and beautiful (and long).
1.0,dolce_vita,"After watching it twice, and fully understanding it...i can safely say, 5 stars x"
1.0,dolce_vita,My first Fellini Movie and one of my top faves.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Yes the film is long, but Fellini is not one of the world's greatest directors for nothing. Love the edgy style, the incredible b/w cinemography. Its one the great classics, a must see."
1.0,dolce_vita,"A brilliant, haunting, and unique. An amazing Fellini film that I saw when I was younger and really want to watch again."
1.0,dolce_vita,I absolutely love this movie!
1.0,dolce_vita,"A masterpeice. Definetly edgey for 1960. I liked how the story was told by following Marcello from scene to scene rather than a flat, run-of-the-mill story. A great cornerstone for the filmmaking world."
1.0,dolce_vita,Masterpiece 50 years old still 50 years ahead of its time
1.0,dolce_vita,"A classic masterpiece! Almost half a century on, it is still so relevant! The easy-going lifestyle of urban young elite, without any depth in relationships, looking for some extra fun, but the morning light brings only dissappointment..."
1.0,dolce_vita,"very impressive, makes you think about lots of things"
1.0,dolce_vita,"I really find amazing how the characters of Dolce Vita are never ready to make a full decision on something. At the same time, their efforts for communication are always uncomplete. Aren't these describe our life, with many opportunites, the next moment leaving us with a bitter sense... Oh Rome!"
1.0,dolce_vita,"This is quite likely my favorite film, period."
1.0,dolce_vita,best fellini!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,dolce_vita,"A Fellini masterpiece. Exuberant and exhilarating. It was both scandalous and thrilling. A smorgasborg of themes reach dizzying heights in this decadent epic dealing with celebrities, paparrazi and debauchery."
1.0,dolce_vita,The best movie of all the times.. Not enough stars to rate this movie
1.0,dolce_vita,"If I had to live in a movie, it would be this one....I know. What does that make me?"
1.0,dolce_vita,Absolutely one of the finest films ever made...
0.0,dolce_vita,"Interesting few film tricks, but mostly long, boring, about nothing, don't bother."
1.0,dolce_vita,This movie left me kind of numb at the end. Almost too much to absorb at once. I love the scene where the balloons follow the clown out of the room. This is a movie I could watch repeatedly and probably never understand fully.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Cynically beautiful, beautifully cynical."
1.0,dolce_vita,"A powerhouse of dialogue, music, humor, sex, and cinematography into one of the most sensual surrealist film. One of the All-Time Best."
1.0,dolce_vita,I can completely relate to Marcello.
1.0,dolce_vita,A mith. Marcello is too sensitive for not recognizing the corruption around him and too smart for not being attracted
1.0,dolce_vita,"The best director from the history made this one for everybody realize that the world is crazy. Marcello Mastroianni in an historica char, a legend scene with Anita Ekber. If shock me in these days, I can Imagine in 50 years ago...."
0.0,dolce_vita,I can never pay attention during this movie. And the presence of Nico just annoys the hell out of me. Not my favorite Fellini.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Stylish, iconic film."
1.0,dolce_vita,I can't really say anything that hasn't been said before. A spot on piece of world cinema directed by a great master.
1.0,dolce_vita,"One of the best movies, but slow and complex. It shares many of the problems we face today with the views of the Italian High society of the 50's. It is a treatise on sociology."
1.0,dolce_vita,Self-loathing has never been so beautiful.
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini's dark side deeply explored. Most people cannot watch this movie. It holds nothing back on the meaninglessness of life. It haunts and haunts you.
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini's dark side deeply explored. Most people cannot watch this movie. It holds nothing back on the meaninglessness of life. It haunts and haunts you.
1.0,dolce_vita,"A miracle of a movie. I won't belittle it by saying more. A film one simply must see (but wait til you are at the age when you start having doubts about the true meaning of life before doing so- even though the film, perhaps rightfully, gives no answer, it will surely feed your own questionings)."
1.0,dolce_vita,"This is exactly the sort of film cinema was invented for, only wish I had seen it years ago..."
1.0,dolce_vita,Seductive and evocative... Its beautiful. I loved this film.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Sad, frustrating, beautiful. Never get tired of this movie."
1.0,dolce_vita,also for fellini...watch more...watch more...
1.0,dolce_vita,Mastroianni was so damn cool! Fellini's characterization of the women in his film is so damn brilliant and the plot structure very inventive. Favorite Fellini film.
1.0,dolce_vita,Seven days and seven nights on the Seven hills of Rome...a scathing indictment of the spiritual decay of the jet-set upper class
1.0,dolce_vita,amazing on so many levels. really one of the best films of all time. and it made me fall in love with marcello. i could say alot more...
1.0,dolce_vita,The only real italian kolossal. For the critic and for the audience. Wanna dance?
1.0,dolce_vita,Beautiful and surreal.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Quite simply the best movie ever made. I could fill my whole list with Fellinis, but I'll settle for this."
1.0,dolce_vita,"This movie is among the top three movies I've seen in my life.Mastroanni beautifully portrays the character Marcello , his likes, dislikes, monotonous parties,sexual encounters and finally the intellectual death....If you watch this movie once you can never forget this stuff in your whole life...."
1.0,dolce_vita,"An erotic, existentialist, and irresistably seductive masterpiece."
0.0,dolce_vita,Worst film I have ever seen. Made me puke.
1.0,dolce_vita,Incredible movie with so much style. A must-see for all fans of the movies
1.0,dolce_vita,This movie makes me feel proud of being italian. A classic that will never die.
1.0,dolce_vita,An amazing film that speaks volumes of the unsatisfiable desires of the human heart.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Fellini, Fellini ,Fellini !"
1.0,dolce_vita,"Probably my favorite. Movie, that is."
1.0,dolce_vita,"A personal top ten, top three actually."
1.0,dolce_vita,Might drag on a bit but that's all part of the fun.
1.0,dolce_vita,I am born 50 years too late!
1.0,dolce_vita,i could watch this movie a thousand times and it would blow my mind a little bit more each time.
1.0,dolce_vita,The best italian actor and the best director ever together
1.0,dolce_vita,"The best Fellini's for me, a fannastic portrait of the 60's Rome with great characters"
1.0,dolce_vita,brilliant!!!Marcello Mastroianni as always
1.0,dolce_vita,Le meilleur film de Fellini.
1.0,dolce_vita,one of my favorite films ever. a masterpiece.
1.0,dolce_vita,Too good. Just too good.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Great European film, one of Federicos Fellini's best films"
1.0,dolce_vita,Fantastiske Fellini ;-)
1.0,dolce_vita,I can watch this film over and over and love observing new things in the character development.
1.0,dolce_vita,FELLINI ERES GRANDE!!!!
1.0,dolce_vita,"Ahead of it's time,very Hip, Chic, and I love the language...ciao!"
1.0,dolce_vita,Why does this movie seem more and more relevant? It's a must see every other year or so... just so we can see how far we HAVEN'T come when it comes to the banality of pop culture
1.0,dolce_vita,"This is my FAVORITE film! So compelling, a visual and emotional feast. Bravo Fellini!"
1.0,dolce_vita,"Marcello is fantastic again. Following him around Rome into public and personal scenes is compelling indeed, at times uncomfortable and certainly enjoyable as well."
1.0,dolce_vita,Brilliant Italian classic!
1.0,dolce_vita,the world doesnt make movies like this anymore
1.0,dolce_vita,"MI FAVORITA DE FELLINI. QUIZA LA MAS DESOLADORA. LA DECADENCIA DEL ULTIMO TERCIO, SOBRE TODO EN LA FIESTA, ES ALGO CON LO QUE LAMENTABLEMENTE UNO NO PUEDE DEJAR DE EMPATIZAR."
1.0,dolce_vita,"This is one of my favorite movies and my favorite Fellini flick. Its themes still apply to society 100% today and even more so in America than almost 50 years ago in Italy. Marcello's inner conflicts to me are some of the most interesting ever explored on film. Also, Antia Ekberg is beyond amazing"
1.0,dolce_vita,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini is a genius and Marcello Mastroianni could be the coolest man to ever walk the earth
1.0,dolce_vita,nothing sexier than italian cinema than Mastriani in this film-
1.0,dolce_vita,"The best movie from Fellini. Although the story might seem to be tedious, we saw Fellini`s trasforming. His spirit was so connected with Marcello destructed and evaporated."
1.0,dolce_vita,"The most brilliant insight portrait of Italy, in Rome, at the end of the ""roaring '50s"", between gossip, celebrities, and fashion. A masterpiece wonderfully directed by Federico and interpreted by Marcello Mastroianni, his alter-ego on the screen!"
1.0,dolce_vita,"Fucking brilliant from beginning to end. And it's so beautiful, you might not notice that this film is really a condemnation of idolatry in the modern world."
1.0,dolce_vita,I love it. A true great. They just don't make em like this anymore.
1.0,dolce_vita,"A triumph of Italian cinema and one of Fellini's best. After watching it I became oddly attached to it, especially to Marcello."
1.0,dolce_vita,One of the best films ever made.
1.0,dolce_vita,Fucking brilliant. See it.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Boobs. Glorious, gigantic boobs. Redefined the boob film. Also, Marcello Mastroianni and the origin of the Paparazzi."
1.0,dolce_vita,This movie has it all and defines everything that was sexy and wonderful about Roma (and Italy) in the late 50s/early 60s.
1.0,dolce_vita,"OÃ¹ l'on se demande oÃ¹ peut bien aller JÃ©sus, qui passe dans le ciel..."
1.0,dolce_vita,True movie magic bliss. Has an endless list of memorable scenes. Fellini at the top of his game.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Lo mejor es esa fiesta media sordida-vip, media surrealista, media patetica, esta pelicula me da la sensacion de estar durmiendo, se parece mucho a los suenos q tengo. 50 anos y sigue haciendo sentido la decadencia y el glamour. Amo a Marcello, esta muuuy weno."
1.0,dolce_vita,I know that 8 1/2 is great but I'm still partial to La Dolce Vita. It's downright magical.
1.0,dolce_vita,May be my favorite film of all time.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Is this movie really 3 hours long? It positively whizzes by. And how can a black & white movie seem so colorful? Oh, and the Nino Rota score -- this one makes the Best of All Time list."
1.0,dolce_vita,It took me some time to trully appreciate how incredible this movie and how many memorable scenes it contains!! LOVE IT
1.0,dolce_vita,just about everything in this movie makes it worth watching... all its strong and weak points (in any opinion) make it unforgettable
1.0,dolce_vita,This is a wonderful film about the sweet life and how fucked up it makes people.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Don't complain about it being slow, it's done in neo-realist style. It's perfect, (Think of this as a great cup of coffee, and 8 1/2 will be your cigarette). And if you didn't leave the film feeling empty and lost, you didn't watch it correctly."
1.0,dolce_vita,Is it Rome? Is it Fellini? Is it Mastroianni (as a journalist)? Or is it simply Anita Ekberg in one of the most famous scenes in movie history?
1.0,dolce_vita,Great script and direction. Marcello is wonderful. Anita looks so sexy in this film. Very unusual and absorbing film.
1.0,dolce_vita,i want to have an espresso and swim in the treviso-fountain with this cool guy carrying me out of the water smoking an of course dry cigarette...
1.0,dolce_vita,"the characters, the black and white shots make this movie unforgettable."
1.0,dolce_vita,"This tremendous movie, full of noise and spectacle, is a well thought-out utterance which provokes very serious thought. The movie I most want to watch again and again until I understand everything. Plus, Ekberg. Oh, and Marcello."
1.0,dolce_vita,An amazing Fellini film.
1.0,dolce_vita,Wonderful. Mesmerizing. A Classic and an iconic film. It deserves it.
1.0,dolce_vita,"you can always enjoy good music, food and girls...make sure you have at least one good suit!"
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini is probably a man with an eye in the future 50 years before...
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini is so awesome that he's been turned into an adjective (much like Steven Segal). He's not all whimsical and surreal. This message of the movie is pretty grim. We're all fucked. In Italian. With Fountains and cleavage. See it!
1.0,dolce_vita,Perhaps the greatest film ever made
1.0,dolce_vita,What stikes me about this movie is that is amazingly up to date...
1.0,dolce_vita,"Fontana di trevi, know who doesn't wanna swim there??"
1.0,dolce_vita,apperently recreating the fountain is illegal-who would have guessed?
1.0,dolce_vita,There aren't enough adjectives to describe this film. Bravo!
1.0,dolce_vita,NO NEED TO SAY AGAIN.... ROME ROME ROME!!!!!
1.0,dolce_vita,see it on the big screen if you can is all I can say. It's the most lively tragic film ever to come from Italy; Fellini could have only topped himself with 8 1/2. Those who can't stand the papparazzi would do well to see the coining of the term here with a character named Papparazzo
1.0,dolce_vita,One of the few very magical films. Recommended for all to see.
1.0,dolce_vita,"As in most of Fellini's films, you can't stop smiling and being sucked into the circus of his characters and their scenarios. Light never looked so good."
1.0,dolce_vita,"Very surreal movie watching experience. It's like an amazing party that goes on for way too long -- you're tired, you want to go home, but you can't shake the feeling that you'll remember the night for the rest of your life."
1.0,dolce_vita,Great Flick. Very haunting and unreal feeling. Especially Mastrioni's lonely et confident expressions. I love this one.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Enfin réussi à le voir en entier en une seule fois. Film déroutant et passionnant, sa structure me plaît beaucoup, réalisation et interprétation sans faille."
1.0,dolce_vita,"Fellini is brilliant, always. This is one of his must see films. MUST SEE."
1.0,dolce_vita,perfect . need say no more -- real filmaking
1.0,dolce_vita,You canno't forget any of the marvellous scenes from this neo realistic expression of Italia....
1.0,dolce_vita,Anita Eckberg. Cloning was invented for just such occasions.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Great, Giant,,,masterpiece..."
1.0,dolce_vita,"Master Fellini at his best. The glamour of another era in the world and filmmaking is present in this masterpiece, showing the decadence of the elite in a superb way. Mastroiani and Anita Eckberg are one of the greatest couples in cinema's history. Brilliant."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"Magnificent, ravishing, elegiac. The sets alone are worth the price of admission."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"There is no doubt that this movie is masterpiece, an epic and beautiful mosaic of interrelated conflicts that all culminate into a 45 minute ballroom sequence that is both moving and jaw-dropping."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,Not much more to say except historical epics rarely come as beautiful as this one.
1.0,the_leopard_1963,Great movie. Great piece of film-making with its many riveting scenes and dialogues and incredibly wonderful and colorful actors. This film for the eye is like a long and pleasing song to the ear.
1.0,the_leopard_1963,BEAUTIFUL MASTER'SPIECE
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"A masterpiece. The work of an incredibly confident director - perfectly paced, sophisticatedly staged, never saying too much, resonating with themes of loss, change, acceptance."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,Probably the best costume drama I've ever seen. One of the most beautiful film's I've ever seen. Watch it.
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"Very little action. Mostly just... circumstance, style, character, history, substance? This is a good movie."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"Why Visconti can be mentioned in the same breath as Fellini and Antonioni. The pinnacle of epic cinema, on par with Lawrence of Arabia."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"One of my four or five choices for best film ever made. Maybe not for everyone, but an extremely rewarding film experiece."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"One of the finest, smartest historical screen epics of the age, or any other for that matter."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,Excellent film. I learned a great deal about Sicilian history.Burt Lancaster was surprisingly believable as a Sicilian Prince. I could tast the dust and feel the heat in those travel scenes
0.0,the_leopard_1963,Definitely not worth 3 hours...an hour of it must have been the kissing and dancing scenes alone. This movie was wayy to slow paced and drawn out than it needed to be.
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"Beautiful, just a touch too self-indulgent like the Sicilian character."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,The most beautiful movie ever made.
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"My God, that was a gorgeous film."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,Astonishing Epic Drama focusing on the inevitable political change in 19th-century Italy.

1.0,the_leopard_1963,Beautiful and sad movie about aging and the end of a certain way of life.
1.0,the_leopard_1963,An epic masterpiece of Italian cinema!
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"Just saw Luchino Visconti's Il Gattopardo in a restored print at the George Eastman House this evening...my God, what an experience. Clocking in at just over 3 hours, this epic tale of the last years of a Sicilian Prince during the Garibaldi era.On the surface, it is the story of the end of an age"
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"A little like Gone With the Wind, but set in 1860 Italy during the unification. Martin Scorsese says everyone should see this movie....I agree -- it's pretty magnificent. The 35mm restoration is probably playing at an art house theater near you!"
1.0,the_leopard_1963,Nobles also cross the dance flow... Amazing movie: so many details but understatement is still main speech.
1.0,the_leopard_1963,DULL ENDING BUT GREAT FILM.

1.0,the_leopard_1963,alain delon could convince me to do anything he wanted just by flashing those pretty blue eyes. eeing this movie fits in the category.
1.0,the_leopard_1963,An interesting story.
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"The epic war drama that ""Gone With The Wind"" wished it could be. Plus Burt Lancaster is a bamf and Claudia Cardinale is a hottie. What more can you ask for?"
1.0,the_leopard_1963,A great big sigh of a movie. Beautiful and moving.
1.0,the_leopard_1963,Beautiful scenes and gives you great insight into Sicilian mentality.
1.0,the_leopard_1963,Burt lancasteras an italian? Yes!
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"Great Epic. All the historical background is the best part. Burt Lancaster is actually reading his lines in English, and later got dubbed!"
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"La plus belle fresque sur le Risorgiomento. Delon - Lancaster, le choc des Titans sous la direction magistrale de Visconti. Et Cardinale, bellisima ! ""Il faut tout changer pour que tout reste comme avant."

1.0,the_leopard_1963,Just two words that fully describe its greatness: Beautifull and Brilliant.
1.0,the_leopard_1963,The best film to ever come out of Italy. An all around beautiful movie.
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"An unparalleled historical epic, with an inspired international cast, brilliant directing, gorgeous photography... If you think ballroom scenes are only for those who like to look at elegant clothes and dancing, then the final scene of this film will be a revelation."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"3 hrs and 25 mins. of Visconti directing Lancaster, Cardinale and Delon. You're either on board or you've mizzed the boat. One of the most beautifully filmed movies ever. One of my prized dvds. Criterion has outshone themselves once again. This movie and a rainy afternoon. Perfection."

1.0,the_leopard_1963,"Quite possibly one of the best films I've ever seen, people."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,My favorite Lancaster film. The ballroom scene can't be beat.
1.0,the_leopard_1963,Terrifying and subtle; the tragedy of a shifting world.
1.0,the_leopard_1963,You should watch only the 3 and a half hour Italian version. It's amazingly brilliant especially the end with the ballroom dance.
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"Tragically ironic and wonderful and joyous. Burt Lancaster gives a truly staggering performance, under the superb hand of Visconti. Claudia Cardinale couldn't be more beautiful and alluring and Alain Delon hits all the right notes. A film whose opulence is never confused by its transience."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,Visconti and neorealism in Italy
0.0,the_leopard_1963,Good acting but way too long. Story is similar to any other aristocratic family; everybody's matched according to the best interest of the family.
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"Exquisite. Lancaster commands the screen, and Delon and Cardinale make one of the most gorgeous couples ever filmed. A lucid meditation about coming to grips with one's irrelevance..."

1.0,the_leopard_1963,"""Il faut que tout change pour que tout reste comme avant"""
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"This is Visconti Â´s masterpiece and one of the visually most breathtaking films of World Cinema. Lancaster really is prince Salina. Nino RotaÂ´s sweeping romantic music, a mixture of Verdi and Wagner, heightens the filmÂ´s visual power."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"visually beautiful, sociologically so clever, historically fascinating, actors at their best and Visconti a genius"
1.0,the_leopard_1963,A wonderful film that stayed with me long after I've seen it - a study of love and death and the amazing way in which they meet.
1.0,the_leopard_1963,Must-see. Beautiful.

1.0,the_leopard_1963,"""we are the leopards but the jackals are coming"""
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"The most gorgeous cinema experience of my life, thank God for re-releases. Operatic, epic, sumptuous, a feast, I am only sad that on DVD, this will never come to life. The look is incredible, still today, cause of Visconti's insistence on the real thing rather than props and scenery."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"An amazing film. Beautifully done. All ""period"" pieces should be held to this standard. Very long, but easy to escape into and feel like you are there."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"Glamour, romance, social commentary, history, family drama, all mixed in this sublime concoction and served cool by Visconti. Watch the Italian version, not the English one."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"One of the most beautiful films ever made, the much famed ball sequence, which takes up the last 1/2 hour is one of the best set sequences ever filmed. The full version is finally available in a subtitled print, however Lancaster spoke English is dubbed into Italian and subtitled back into English!"
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"Class struggles, generational differences and individual morality on Sicily and on a great scale. As awe-inspiring as Gone With the Wind, but at least twice as intelligent."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,certaily the best piece of Burt Lancaster. One of the best films of 60's. And what can be said about Claudia Cardinale.She is the pretiest woman on screen- I guess.
1.0,the_leopard_1963,An absolute gem...what photography...true to the novel in every detail...amazing...but it's Visconti after all...
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"The best way I can describe it, which doesn't do it justice, is the Italian Gone with the wind. However, that's because it takes place during Italy's defining moments. Though the stakes are much more intellectual and thought out than just a tragic love story set against the back drop of war."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"Que delicioso retrato de la aristocracia y de la sociedad italiana. Que claridad para ver las relaciones sociales entre los habitantes del pueblo, entre el pueblo y el poder. La escena del banquete, la figura y la risa espectacular de Claudia Cardinale son inolvidables."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,Magnificent subtlety.

1.0,the_leopard_1963,"Things must change so that things can remain the same. Three hours of some of the most sumptuousl looking truth that you will ever behold. Claudia Cardinale is the grade A, number one, sexiest woman that ever lived. I double dare you to tell me of another."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,Watch out for the scene-stealing ginger cat in the final scene!
1.0,the_leopard_1963,I could watch this again and again and again

1.0,the_leopard_1963,"The meek reality of the rich and aristocratic as seen through the eyes of an aging patriarch. If you like The Godfather, consider this its prequel."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,Sicily and sicilianity... from my favourite book!
1.0,the_leopard_1963,amazing ..watch the final ball sequence...might need to know a lil italian history before watching

1.0,the_leopard_1963,"I love this, its as close as anyone could ever get to the spirit of that incredible book."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"Visconti's masterwork feels like a series of Rembrant paintings in motion, all slowly revealing the deterioration of the Sicilian aristocracy through the wrinkled and weary eyes of Burt Lancaster."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,This is an absolutely astonishing film. Loved it.
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"Sure, you can say that the pace is slow, but you shouldn't really notice that as you take in the sheer cinematic beauty that Visconti captures with this film"

1.0,the_leopard_1963,A rare and amazing film. Must see for anybody.
1.0,the_leopard_1963,A brilliant evocation of the Risorgimento - with splendid performances from Lancaster and Delon with Claudia Cardinale quite breath-taking in her beauty as the parvenu on the move. Stunning direction by Visconti.
1.0,the_leopard_1963,Beautiful and unsettling as all great art should surely be
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"Fantastic, beautiful film!"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"This is a masterpiece - elaborately demonstrating how to block a scene and edit in accordance with style, and effortlessly explaining the rules and manufacturing of the cinematic medium."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,The plot balance is amazing. All-around very well made movie with deep meaning.
0.0,the_rules_of_the_game,I just wasn't really able to follow this. Maybe because I'm sleep deprived. But I also found it hard to care about these characters. Is the point that they're all hypocrites or tritely immoral? Okay.... plenty of people are. Why should I care?
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Talvez a mais precisa e mordaz crítica à superficialidade burguesa. Uma obra extremamente política travestida de comédia de costumes.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Incredible film. Everything was superb!
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"The brilliance of the film apparently eluded audiences at its release, but seen nowadays, it ranks among the supreme masterpieces of moviemaking."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Very Shakespearian in its tragic elements. We see this tale unravel in complete and utter chaos. It's breathtaking.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,It's overwhelming tragedy makes you crush your heart yet it grows into you oh so fondly.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Overrated. But brilliant. I just think Jean Renoir put out some better material that doesn't get the credit this one does.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A moral narrative on amorality. Enjoyed longer takes in contrast to annoying editting.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Après ce film de Renoir, le cinéma est entré dans une nouvelle ère qui - bien qu'ayant depuis connu maintes innovations et maintes évolutions - perdure encore à travers la vision géniale de Renoir."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Probably the best cinematic example of using lies to tell the truth. Simply marvelous entertainment.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"One of the greatest movies ever made, yo. It's like YEEEAAAAHHH MY MAN, JEAN, MAN. HE'S MY BOY. MAH BOY."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A message of substantial proportions, a class of souring sensibilities, La RÃ¨gle du Jeu is powerful, potent and smart."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Jean Renoir is the director who best explains on screen that most people are neither good or bad; but sometimes do good things and sometimes do bad things. He finds humanity in every character.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Absolutely stunning to behold. Renoir's definitive work. Manages to celebrate, condemn, and mourn pre-war french decadence."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"One of the greatest movies ever made, yo. It's like YEEEAAAAHHH MY MAN, JEAN, MAN. HE'S MY BOY. MAH BOY."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Jean renoir's masterpiece The rules of the game is the most authentic and original film of the classic cinema. his vision of the low class with the high class is superb, even when the two classes collide is fantastic, the connection between the poor and the rich and their desires and misadventures."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Not only works as a clever satire of upper class society, but as a precursor to modern affair based films. This may very well be one of the greatest of the silent films I have seen as of yet (though city lights is still my favourite). Excellent!"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"At this point, we've run out of ways to say that this is a great movie."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Terrific. Of course.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Renoir's tragicomedy set in pre-WWII France is an absolute delight. The director's use of deep focus combined with long takes allows the film to progress in a remarkably lifelike manner.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A rule-breaking, jaw-dropping fabulous comedy; a whirling, seething, absolutely scathing look at the French upper class, running pell-mell like lemmings into the sea. One of the greatest, darkest comedies ever made."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"If you are a fan of Robert Altman ensamble pictures, you need to see this film"

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"yes, we all have our reasons."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,One of the masterpieces cinema has to offer. The way the camera moves in this is simply amazing. You'll rarely see a movie staged as well as this.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Devastating. Part comedy of manners, part slamming door farce, all wrapped up in a shell of class warfare and their similarities. I am in pure awe of this perfect film."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"It's no insult to call the film an uncompromising, fascinatingly sophisticated echo of Hemmingway's 'The Sun Also Rises'."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,An absolutely sublime film. My 2nd favorite film of all time - following only Les Enfants du Paradis.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Jean Renoir`s satire of human manners is easily one of the most profound and multifaceted films I`ve ever seen!
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Jean Renoir's masterpiece is easily one of the first great films of the 20th Century.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,One of the greatest films of all time.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Genius. This is what I want to create, but with wider themes on a global scale. No pressure."

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Soooooo good. Just brilliant.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"One of those movies you can watch over and over. The characters are shallow and complex, shrill and humorous, affected and vulnerable, all amounting to a tragicomic highwire act of dour resplendence."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"One of the most important films ever made, Revoir's classic stands through the weathering of time, without being rusted a bit."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Other films seem to make more sense after watching a classic, from any decade really. This most certainly is one and it's spellbinding!"
0.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"This film takes the word ""boring"" to an ungodly new level.  What could possibly incite anyone to enjoy watching this is absolutely beyond me."

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A Summer's Tale: Again I am in love with a Rohmer's character. It's not hard to guess which one, if you've seen this film. The Rules of the Game: Ah... finally I watched this. Amazing how so much is said, but what is untold carries even more depth."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,One of my all time favourites. Full review coming up.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Every frame of La regle du jeu seems dominated by Renoir's personality; yet the most appealing facets of that personality are generosity, openness, responsiveness. As a result, La regle is at once the auteur film par excellence and a work of co-operation and active participation"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Renoir's painfully brilliant comedy of manners is one of the best films of all, a masterpiece of movement, and a balancing act of character. In the words of Desson Thomson, it is life at its messiest unfolding at its most beautiful."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Renoir truly creates a masterpiece here. A biting look at high society in France at the time, this 'controversial' film is gorgeous nigh its whole length. It's vilification of society is matched in efficacy only by it's humor, which is dark and transgressive."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Often regarded as a precursor to Citizen Kane as the first modern sound film
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A very great masterpiece, 'Rules of the Game"" is to film what ""Don Giovanni"" is to opera--a perfect work of art and the completion of its genre"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Renoir's finest, as I am sure many directors would confess for copying Renoir's style. Obviously better films have been made in the same genre, just remember is was Renoir was the first to make such a film, thus the origionality is his, an no one elses."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A great, sprawling film full of realistic characters, depth, and charm."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A brilliant social commentary that is totally deserving of it's reputation as one of the best film's ever made.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A stunning portrayl of a tottering society on the verge of calamity with countless imitated sequences.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Takes the cinema to places that not other director has gone.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A masterpiece. Also, Jean Renoir in a bear suit. What up."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"For many film lovers, there's Jean Renoir, and then everybody else. Well one look at this astonishing film, and it's hard to dispute such a notion. Rules of The Game may very well be the Citizen Kane of French cinema. Check it out."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Starts slowly, but develops beautifully into a rich space."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,One of the best and memorable French b&w; movies. Satirical look on bourgeoisie is packed with walloping punches from an amazing script and excellent Renoir direction. And that ending is sadly haunting.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"So quintessentially a French cultural experience, it's almost equivalent to the first time one sees Paris at night. Cinematic perfection."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Clasico del cine frances acerca de ""los de arriba y los de abajo"" que en su epoca fue un completo fracaso de taquilla. Ahora es un trabajo absorbente, complejo, lleno de dialogos inolvidables y con una fotografia exquisita. Un trabajo inmortal."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Quite simply one of the greatest movies ever made. An intricately crafted work that never loses touch with the intimate human elements of the characters it depicts. All the more amazing since it seems to be so... effortless.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,In the same league as Citizen Kane in that any descriptions do not suffice this film's grandeur.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Cada vez que ves esta Obra maestra sacas nuevos detalles que antes te perdiste :D
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Though it is my opinion this film is over rated-it's not one of the greatest films, it still deserves a top rating. It's basically about how passions can lead people astray and make them act foolishly. The ending is somewhat shocking and justifiably legendary."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,this one hit me like a ton of bricks.
0.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"I appreciate the satire and that it was good for its time, 70 years ago, but I found it quite boring to watch. Plus they seemed to be speaking too fast!"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Just about one of the best films i've ever seen.

0.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Although the movie is very well made, it is not one that I would consider watching again and again. The movie magic just isn't here for me."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Towering masterpiece from a time when film directors still respected their audience and aspired to communicate something about the human condition. This film as as life-affirming as most contemporary cinema is the opposite
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"The perfect example of a farce, with the added inclusion of a tragic ending."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Renoir stages a tracking shot like no other. Great drama, great story, great characters. Just awesome all around."

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,An engaging and exciting film full of elegant surprises! Renoir's finest!
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Perfect, the ultimate movie. Far too dense to absorb. Every role, every movement, every element of stage, every breath, evey word, eveything has a purpose. The equal of citizen Kane if not superior, really amazing."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Superb comedy of class, manners, behavior. Fine performances. People who like Gosford Park (and Robert Altman films in general) will get a lot out of this one."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,One of the BEST films ever made. period.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"I bought and watched this one cold, only knowing that it was ranked as the number 3 movie of all time in a census of film critics and directors. And this scathing attack of the fickle French bourgeoisie deserves to be there."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A masterful microcosm of Europe on the brink of cultural collapse
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Renoir is charming and funny. He believes in the good in humanity.I'm in love with Octave.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A great movie to revisit at any time - on the grandness and pettiness of love, friendship, and human emotions in general. Unforgettable characters. Jean Renoir is great for an actor, too, not only for a director! Can't believe it's from 1939 - beats anything I've seen from the new century..."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"It's better every time you see it, especially with all the extras in the Criterion Edition."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,psycho...for its time...talk about putting all that has never ever been said upfront..coldly in a movie....thats bravado....
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Oh my yes. One of the best movies ever made. If you're reviewing this movie, then you are familiar with it and I dont have to explain that is a an amazing satire on the class system in 3rd Republic France blah blah blah"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,I remember this film. Saw it way back in College.. FAntastic. ..Now I want to see it again. Renoir--sheer genious
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,There's a time and a place to cheat on your spouse. Just don't do it the day of the big hunt.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,There is no reason not to see this.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"This wonderful film is lucky to still be intact after bannings by the French government and burnings of all available copies by the Nazis. That being said, the movie explores the tense relationships between lovers and friends in the pre-War French high society."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Es tan espectacular que hay que verlo para creerlo. Todo es innegablemente excelente, obra maestra de obras maestras. Sin palabras."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Fantastic movie. A must see if you have not done so yet. Picks apart the upper classes and caused a ton of controversy. A must see, I don't know how much more I can stress that."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Classic Renoir. Nuff' said.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"I know the film is about the French pre-war aristocracy, but I loved what it had to say about love, lust, and friendship, and how often they can be concealed or confused."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A great movie for those who love movies. One of the first films ever shot it depth, Rules of the Game is technically far ahead of its time. Beyond that, the characters are well developed, and the implication of montage shows the tension of pre-WWII France as the war draws nearer."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,One of the Cinema's most historically significant and most controversial works is an outstanding irreverent satire of bourgeois sensibilities from the master Renoir.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Considered one of the greatest films of all time. Jean Renoir
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Like ""Gosford Park""? See where it came from here. So much going on in this film, you could watch it ten times and see something new each viewing."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Renoir famously said 'Everybody has their reasons'. This, his most encompassing film, reconciles his obsession with deep staging and focus with his empathy and love for people caught up in their messy lives and problems. Humanist cinemas towering masterpiece."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,This really is the film you can watch over and over and over and keep seeing it as fresh as ever. At least that's how I feel after my fifth viewing. Renoir's films invite you into them - they build walls that set you free to roam within their interiors to discover layers of humanity.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Qu'est-ce tu veux mon vieux, aujourd'hui tout le monde ment...!"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Such a layered film, in plot, theme, and mis-en-scene that it gets better with every viewing."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A rule-breaking, jaw-dropping fabulous comedy; a whirling, seething, absolutely scathing look at the French upper class, running pell-mell like lemmings into the sea. One of the greatest, darkest comedies ever made."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A masterpiece of understatement and half-expressed emotion, with a lot of colorful and interesting characters put through their paces in a narrative that doesn't force anything."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Great dark comedy. Highly recommended.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,The only correct answer to the question; What is the best movie ever made.

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Avec Citizen Kane, le film le plus ambitieux de tous les temps."

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,The Greatest Film Ever Made.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Una commedia ironica e disincantata perfetta in ogni suo aspetto.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Possibly the greatest film ever made. I've seen it a dozen times and never get tired of it. The recent digital restoration makes it even better.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Really liked it 16 years ago. Should probably re-view it sometime.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,This is why I decided to be a Director
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,it feels like your peeking through the bushes watching this.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Better than Citizen Kane and was made 2 years before. Wonderfully beautiful film, use of the moving camera and different plains of action was radical and groundbreaking. Great Movie."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Tout simplement un film brillant. Peut-être plus important encore que ne l'est Citizen Kane. Les longs travellings en chassé-croisé dans le couloir de l'hotel sont des moments forts de l'histoire du cinema.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Conveys the hypocrisy and conformity in social circles perfectly. Renoir's best film, perhaps."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,One of the finest motion pictures ever made. Absolutely a masterpiece. I cannot recommend it highly enough.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,En stor og strålende film om borgerskapets laster og dyder. I Frankrike får man sågar kjøpt filmmanuset som en vanlig pocketbok.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,One of the greatest films ever made.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Pretentious, Moi! But it is a devastating look at pre-war French society, which confirms many prejudices. And it is made by a Frenchman, which shatters many more."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A humorous movie that pokes fun at the upper-class. One of the finest in french cinema
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Essential Renoir. It's difficult to find a director with two films bot has good as this and The Grand Illusion. Simply Great.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,It's biting and hilarious - and there is a guy in a bear suit (who doesn't love that?).
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Frankly my all-time favorite movie, nothing matches Renoir's extraordrinary direction or his script and the last image is one of the greatest and most haunting images ever put on a screen"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Vicious and biting, yet somehow still oh so funny, The Rules of the Game is one of the best social critiques on film. Renoir goes right for the throat of the oblivious upper class, and he tears their jugular right out. A classic."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Jean Renoir's 1939 masterpiece is still the most humorous film of any decade. Think of it as a caustically hilarious documentary of the discreet charm of the bourgeoisie.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A biting critique on class -- Renoir's calling card
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Two words: Jean Renoir. No one expresses the inherent bittersweet beauty of the human condition better.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Terrific. Of course.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Jean Renoir (son of the Impressionist painter, Auguste) transforms film into art with this movie. Robert Altman borrowed heavily from ""La Regle..."" for his movie ""Gosford Park"" (also fantastic). An acute observation of the upstairs/downstairs world of high society 1930s France."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Renoir is the bestest.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,This is one of the many important Renoir masterpieces. Dude was a true rebel.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,what can you say about the greatest film right before the beginning of the greatest war?
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A movie by Jean Renoir
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"The original upstairs, downstairs examination. The sheer depth of material that Renoir is able to capture in his long takes is mighty impressive. As is the dramatic but still inherently complex emotionally honest lives of the film's many characters."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Why does PT Anderson love Renoir so much? Well look at how much he takes from him (excluding There Will be Blood). The fluidity of movement and space in this film is just off the charts. Engaging to watch.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"So widely (and wisely) praised now that it's tempting to resist iconoclastically, but this is really a wonderful movie. Notice the incredible use of countryside footage - fields and grasses and grounds. This film looks like no other. It's set and filmed like no other. It's so unspeakably gorgeous."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,This film gets every character right and has to be one of the first to make full use of cinema's possibilities for using space to tell a story.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Another one of those films that is considered among the 'best of all time' that actually lives up to hype. Visually this has to be one of the most sophisticated films ever, but it is never showy or obvious."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,really holds up well to repeated viewings. i think i prefer this one to grand illusion even
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Life is like that, sometimes."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Was surprised at how bad ass this movie is. Classic? Yep. Long takes? Yep. Commentary on the class system? YEP!
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,How can I only be seeing this for the first time? Jean Renoir's story of a disastrous country house weekend in pre-WWII France is a devastating look at the folly of over-reliance on social mores. Essential viewing.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,pretty much a perfect film.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"I was surprised at how modern the characters were in this. I know that seems strange, but considering the year it was released, I didn't expect male-female relationships to be so easy (I see the irony, considering the end)."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A delightfully comic but equally scathing commentary on the hollowness of the aristocratic pre-World War II French society.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Renoir et tous les acteurs sont bons!
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Quite possibly the best film ever made. Moves with such energy and wit. The pace and intense characterization are outstanding! With each viewing, there is always something new to be absorbed. For anyone interested in classic cinema, this is a beast to be reckoned with, in the best possible way."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A ferocious social commentary. If you were to give the script to a studio in these days, there's no way they would fund a production for it."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Brilliant, layered, subtle, I have seen this 3 times and each time I discover something new. The cinematography is breath taking this film is a must!"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"One of the best movies ever made? Yeah, yeah, that's about right."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A must see - french classic - life of the privileged.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Social engagement as sexual revolution. This movie turns your adopted Puritan ideas of 'the way sex should be' on it's ear. What's more, it was made in 1939. Beat that, Closer*.*movie starring Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"One of the most beautiful films of all time, it is so consistent, the acting is superb and Renior is a genius behind the camera and the angles and positioning"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A perfect movie in its way.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Meilleur film francais ever ?
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,One of the all time greats!
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"I've read that a true classic grows with each reading/viewing. That is exactly why this is my favorite movie. I generally don't go in for wishing I could meet people from the past, but Jean Renoir is the exception."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"The movie where Jean Renoir explore the sequence plan and the image great gray scale to tell us a modern 1939 fable about love, jealousy and death between a noble married couple: he is a French man and she is a German woman."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Absolutely perfect in every way. I've watched it dozens of times over the course of my life and find new things to admire in it every time. If this rating system allowed ten stars, that's what I'd award it. Or thirty. Or a hundred."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Almost 80 years old and still standing the test of time. Little known film (outside of critical studies circles) and should be seen by anyone who gets a chance.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Not only a satire on the upper-class, but a full-on indictment of the facades of human nature. ""Is it a comedy, or is it a tragedy? Either way, it's a masterpiece."""
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"The grandaddy of all those rich-Europeans-gather-at-someone's-estate -for-the-weekend movies. Very funny, very tender and very tragic, this has lots to say about life, love and human folly. Should be required viewing for anyone with a heart."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"this film really stands up to all the critical praise. a wild romp through the french aristocracy circa 1939. renoir's classic is hilarious, meticulously filmed, thoughtfully scripted, and ultimately heartbreaking. this is one of the greats."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"paul schrader considers this the film without which there can possibly be no 'film canon.' i whole-heartedly concur. a brilliant, moving, hilarious and painful film, featuring great performances, great photography, and wonderful dialogue."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A Comedy From France? No. The French can't do comedy--not from the same country where Sartre was born. This is a farce-- It hurts to laugh and that was Renoir's point.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A Black and White French film? Really? But it is amazing that this film written about the different classes in French Society still is resonant today. Octave is one of my favorite characters of all time.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Brilliant, lost for words."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,holy shit freaking amazing.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Yeah, it's one of the best films ever made. There's really not much else I can say."

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Arguably the best film ever made.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"An absolute masterpiece, brilliant satire about class in pre-war France."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Incredible movie by Renoir with a clear indigtment of the decaying morals and social uselessness of the upper classes of pre-war France. A true movie masterpiece and a stinging satire.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A Jean Renoir classic, this film truly deserves its place at the top of many film lists."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Once you get to know Jean Renoir, his films are more rewarding with each viewing. To some it may be dry, but it has such strong complexity to how everything is composed. Characters, movement, timing, conversation, cinematography, DEEP FOCUS, all utilized to gratifying extent."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,An almost perfect mess of drawing-room farce and biting social comment from master director Renoir (son of Auguste). The hunt scene has to be seen to be believed.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"absolute brilliance! a truly bold statement on class rules, and the sheer uselessness of idle people. you may not get it's greatness right away, and thats the brilliance of it. it is so subtle, that it takes a while after viewing it for the true meaning of the film to sink in. a true masterpiece"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A phenomenal film that needs to be seen several times in order to fully appreciate (or even just understand) it's reputation as one of the ""greatest"" movies ever made."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,One of the best French films ever made.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"This is it, folks. This is the film That Which No Greater Can Exist."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Love, real love is when someone is there to help you get out of the bear suit. That thing that people do at their chateaux on hunting weekends--that's not love, just a game that simulates it."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A fascinating look at the alien world of the French upper class before World War II. Essential.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Some critics have called it the greatest film of all time. It's certainly in the running. Highly influential, justifiably so."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Jean Renoir's magnum opus.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Starts off a little slow, but once it gets going its definitely a treat. Renoir's look into class is as fascinating as the characters in the film, but the real achievement of the film is the technical skills displayed- simply outstanding. 9.5/10"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Classic, influential, funny, tragic, and just perfect."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Top 5 movies of all time. The plot is a simple comedy. But the filmmaking skills on display here may never be equalled.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Renoir is one of my favorite directors. If you want to know why just see this gem of a movie that ranks amongst the best movies ever made by anyone in any country.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Renoir's virtuosic dissertation on class relations has remained as fresh as ever, influencing an entire generation of filmmakers from Altman to Godard."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,This is on my top ten favorite movies
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Robert Altman (my favorite director) once famously said ""I learned the rules of the game from The Rules of the Game."" And Altman may be the only director who's shown that he has the breadth of vision that Renoir has in his masterpiece, one of the small handful of the greatest films ever made."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"If I had 5 films to take with me to a desert island, this would be number one. It's a film that you can't reasonably begin to appreciate the first time, and each time after 10, you dicover how awe is a boundless state."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"If an alien species descended upon Earth and asked me to explain to them what is cinema, I wouldn't say a word. I would simply sit them in front of a TV set and show them two films: Citizen Kane and The Rules of the Game."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"It may not have the distinctive look of 'Citizen Kane' or the thrills of Hitchcock, but this is as perfect as films get: fluid, alternately comic and tragic, always graceful in presentation... with just a little bit of sex"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Brilliant. One of the best of all time.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A humanist masterpiece!
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"If you want to learn how to move a camera, all you need to do is watch any Renoir film, especially this, his masterpiece."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Amazing film. Way before its time. The music and cinematography are wonderful.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,If only the French could make more like this.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Pre WWII France. On the same plane as 'Kane.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A wonderful early masterpiece.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,this one is up there.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"One of the four or five best movies ever made, a tantalizing ambiguous portrait of morality, honor, and propriety, with rich characters and incredible photography."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,JADORE ce film. the critique renoir makes is brilliant.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,In my top 5 for sure. By far the best French film of all time by my second favorite director Jean Renoir.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"greatest film ever, period. End of discussion."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"One of the greatest of all time. The camera is a character, exploring and discovering just as much as any of the actual characters. It is funny, sad, and everything in between. It is the elegy to a society that is destined for, and meant for, extinction."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"It's the ending that makes the entire movie worthwhile for me. Good stuff overall; don't let expectations of it being ONE OF THE GREATEST MOVIES EVERRRRRR get in the way of just enjoying it, either."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Early cinematic movie, therefore it's very dramatic but in a good way because it's not too exaggerated. The cast was perfect and there is a surprise ending, but the beauty of this ending is not in of itself--it is NOT the climax of the movie.......you'll just have to watch it"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Easily the greatest movie ever made
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Renoir is just amazing...
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,All-time best Renoir? Hard to choose just one...
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Wow, one of my favorite movies. Renoir really knew how to capitalize on multiple levels of action, and really knew how to play with emotions and test our acceptances of societal conventions. If you like older movies, you definitely have to see this one."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Renoir's brilliant satire of bourgeoisie. Focusing on the lives of many characters and intertwining them perfectly during a weekend hunting trip, this film is one of the greats."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Renoir. With the craftsmanship of his father, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Jean paints a satirically delicate and critical portrait of French aristocracy. Easily outshines The Grand Illusion in my opinion."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"What ""Gosford Park"" wishes it was. Brilliant."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,By far the greatest film EVER made.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Renoir's statement on the bourgeois is done so well. Contains one of my favorite scenes of all times.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Worth seeing just to see Jean Renoir in a bear suit.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Truly one of the classics of film. I am baffled when I heard about all of the people that disliked it upon initial release. This film is absolutely awesome. Renoir was definitely a master of his craft.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Renoir handles the politics of class, sex and (quite literally) the boundaries within and outside le chateau with such deft and artistry. Such a great work of dialogue and imagery-- a striking and potent commentary of a Europe at the edge of another World War."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Beautiful. That is all.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Jean Renoir may be the greatest of all time, and this is his greatest film."

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"one of the greatest movies of all time, ever. took a few viewings to see what was really there, but it is an incredible play of characters and stories, intertwining and paralleling, producing symphonic moral tale. renoir himself stands strong amidst a great cast."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,I've really grown to cherish this more and more over the years.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,This movie almost single-handedly got me into non-English films.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"I always heard the name Jean Renoir tossed around as if he was a good director with movies worth watching. Well, for what I've seen in this, he is a good director with movies worth watching unless you love rabbits. Renoir doesn't love rabbits."

1.0,wages_of_fear,"If your arse cheeks arent as tight as a Japanese taiko drum after watching this, you really don't know the meaning of fear."
1.0,wages_of_fear,"Tension and constant suspense of treachery between the men who are desperate for money as they carry a load of explosives across a risky terrain. Exciting, great acting, and excellent cinematography."
1.0,wages_of_fear,"This is the best suspense film ever. I've seen it several times and am still biting my nails at some of the scenes. Much better than the US remake ""Sorcerer"""
1.0,wages_of_fear,"A classic of suspense and a must see. It sounds cliche to say, but it literally kept me on the edge of my seat, without any stupid murderous axemen, psychotic hotel managers, or any real clear-cut ""villains"" at all."
1.0,wages_of_fear,Wow.Now that's suspense
1.0,wages_of_fear,Outcasts hired to drive transport trucks full of nitroglycerine have to literally inch the trucks through miles of treacherous mountains without jostling the contents or they will explode. One of the most tense movies I have ever seen.
1.0,wages_of_fear,"Wonderful sense of place and time, the decay of the South American village and feeling of dread is perfectly pitched. The line ""Where there's oil there are Americans"" still rings true today. And the last 45 minutes ratchets up the suspense unlike any film since. Toughest film ever made."
1.0,wages_of_fear,"A.K.A ""Le Salaire de la Peur,"" it's excellent French Cinema. Don't expect to be bored because it's old, black and white, and French. This is suspense beyond reason, with an ending... well, i can't give it away, can I? A masterpiece by a director who's, dare i say it, the French Hitchcock."
1.0,wages_of_fear,Perhaps the most intense movie ever made. Don't miss it.
1.0,wages_of_fear,"A true masterpiece, beautifully shot."

1.0,wages_of_fear,"I've yet to see a film to top this one. It has philosophy, action, patho's, bathos, and a strong touch of realism. It's to my mind one of the best bits of filmmaking ever (but dont watch the Hollywod version - it doesn't work)"
1.0,wages_of_fear,Clouzot's masterpiece. Starts out at a fever pitch of suspense and stays there the whole time. Amazing.
1.0,wages_of_fear,"84% of you should be shamed. Go and watch this and see what you're missing. If a film deserves a perfect 10, (5 even?) then this is it. Wonderful."
1.0,wages_of_fear,-All-time greatest thriller! I stayed up late one night as a kid and just happened to catch this epic.
1.0,wages_of_fear,"EL SALARIO DEL MIEDO,JAJAJAJA"
1.0,wages_of_fear,"(AKA Le Salaire de la peur)Un film incroyablement forte. J'adore, entre autres, la scène où Charles Vanel avance pour délimiter son territoire dans le bar. La prise des pieds dans une sens et autre des personnages es magnifique!"

1.0,wages_of_fear,Easily one of the most intense films ever made. I love these old flicks because they focus on a great story line rather than expensive flashy effects.
1.0,wages_of_fear,Absolutely fantastic - it won't loosen its grip until the horrifying finale.
1.0,wages_of_fear,"Awesome! This was remade in the states as Sorcerer, and was itself pretty good. But Wages is excellent!"
1.0,wages_of_fear,This very well might have been an influence for all puzzle solving third-person video games.
1.0,wages_of_fear,"what a wild ride. so supenseful, i'll bet Hitchcock shit his pants seeing this. sorry for the visual but let's be honest, in pictures doesn't it look like he did and is embarrassed everyone will find out."
1.0,wages_of_fear,This is probably the most suspenseful film of all time. You will dig your nails into your own palm.
1.0,wages_of_fear,"AN absoluetly excellent French movie about four bums that get chosen to drive a bunch of nitroglycerine across rugged terrain. Way ahead of it's time. The suspense is killer. Yeah it's 2:30 long and it's in french, but it's well worth your time."
1.0,wages_of_fear,"Most tense film ever! Very simple idea, brilliant direction and photography, awesome acting...Classic."
1.0,wages_of_fear,Bowled over by this classic. Starts off like one of those Huston/Hawks pictures with Yves Montand in the Bogart role; gets very suspenseful and intriguing. Great movie.
1.0,wages_of_fear,"Classic. What other movie has men driving trucks with one ton of liquid nitrogen over the Andes mountains? Slow at first, but picks up pace after the first hour. If you like classics, don't skip this one."
1.0,wages_of_fear,The most exciting film ever made?
1.0,wages_of_fear,"Suspense film touchstone, political lightning rod."
1.0,wages_of_fear,Maybe the most suspensiful movie of all time. The idea is pure dynamite and Clouzot makes most of it. Can't really get any better than this.
1.0,wages_of_fear,Hitchcock often failed to reach this level of exciting suspense
1.0,wages_of_fear,You think your job is hard!

1.0,wages_of_fear,Proletarians of the world unite
1.0,wages_of_fear,"One of the finest, tensest thrillers ever filmed, Clouzot's devilish misanthropy makes for electric cinema. Fights it out with The Godfather, Citizen Kane and Chinatown for the Best Film Ever Made title."
1.0,wages_of_fear,"The first half an hour or so seems like a bit of a slog at first, but persevere and you'll discover the most intense suspense-filled couple of hours ever put to celluloid. If you like this, check out Clouzot's Diaboliques - another little known masterpiece"
1.0,wages_of_fear,"Should be listed next to ""white-knuckled"" in the dictionary. Why William Fredkin through he could remake this is beyond me."
1.0,wages_of_fear,Sweatiest movie ever with Alien and Cool hand Luke taking second and third. The tension is fabulous and you can feel the jungle heat. Spielburg should have watched this before hacking out Jurassic Park.
1.0,wages_of_fear,Best suspense film ever? Maybe so.
1.0,wages_of_fear,The most suspenseful movie I've ever seen. Brilliant and beautiful. Clouzot's wife plays one of the sexiest bar maids ever in a small role.

1.0,wages_of_fear,"A fantastic, suspenseful masterpiece. The story builds slowly, grabs hold of you, and never lets go. Watch this instead of junk like those stupid pirate movies..."
1.0,wages_of_fear,"One of the best movies I've ever seen; natural suspense, nerve wracking--Clouzot seems to be another Hitchcock"
1.0,wages_of_fear,"breathtaking, thrilling ! And a classic !"
1.0,wages_of_fear,The most nerve-wracking film I've ever sat through. I gripped my chair the entire time and at one point thought I might have a heart attack. To see this film is to know Hitchcock wasn't the only master of suspense out there; Clouzot was in a league of his own.
1.0,wages_of_fear,One of the most nerve shreddingly suspenseful films I've ever seen. A misanthropic masterpiece. I had bitten my fingernails off by the end of it.
1.0,wages_of_fear,How movies should be made

1.0,wages_of_fear,Enjoy your fingernails.
1.0,wages_of_fear,"Takes a while to get going, this one - but the slow build takes time to establish characters & why men would put themselves in such a situation. However, once they get moving, one of the most tense, edge-of-your-seat films ever made unfolds! See it now!"
1.0,wages_of_fear,"Nihilistic, bleak and beautiful. The best desperate-men-on-a-suicide-mission-to deliver-a-truck-load-of-nitro-glycerine-to-the-top?of-a-mountain- movie you?ll ever find! If you like happy endings, then steer clear"
1.0,wages_of_fear,"If movies were still made like this, I wouldn't hate life as much as I do now. Well, yes I would, but things would be slightly different, dammit!"

1.0,gone_with_the_wind,A All Time Classic Movie
1.0,gone_with_the_wind,This film shows us a fantastic perspective of an inner struggle within Scarlett O'hara where we get to witness a story of happiness and dispair for a woman who wants nothing but happiness and in return recieves a lifelong lesson where there is truly no place like home!
0.0,gone_with_the_wind,2/10A movie so bad it probably started WWII
1.0,gone_with_the_wind,Long and a little drawn out in places but the cast and acting make up for it.
0.0,gone_with_the_wind,"Too long. Too sappy. TOO HEARTBREAKING! This was a HUGE disappointment. I bought this movie, hoping that I would be watching something DECENT! All in all, I don't recommend it at all. The only good part is Clark Gable"
1.0,gone_with_the_wind,"The thing that makes ""Gone with the wind"" such a classic, is partly Scarlett O'Hara & her volatility, which was great that time, and also the grand scope is so overwhelming on a person. This film is truly a masterpiece of cinema, and a epic feast for the eyes. ."

1.0,gone_with_the_wind,"Despite the length of this film, I never find it boring. Vivian Leigh is perfectly cast as the catty, strong-willed Scarlet. Deserving of every award and accolade, Gone With The Wind never disappoints with its gorgeous photography, color, acting, and passion."

1.0,gone_with_the_wind,The greatest love story of all time because it is almost reality instead of your average fairy tales. Such is life. Too much wisdom from Rhett Butler' s lines as well. You can never get enough of the precious 222 minutes. One still yearns to demand more!! Inspiring. Hurtful. Daring.
1.0,gone_with_the_wind,BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!:)
1.0,gone_with_the_wind,An absolute classic of the old world with an impossibly good performance from Vivien Leigh. Full review later.
1.0,gone_with_the_wind,A true classic in every way. Probably two of the most tragic characters ever portrayed. They do everything to make the audience dislike them but their circumstances and the depth and complexity given to them by Gable and Leigh make them two of the most memorable characters in film history.
1.0,gone_with_the_wind,Absolutely epic in scale while staying totally human. Gone with the End is truly a great picture
1.0,gone_with_the_wind,wonderful movie ð???

1.0,gone_with_the_wind,"The chemistry between Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) and Scarlet O'Hara (Vivian Leigh) was nothing short of electrifying. Made some 70 years ago, when CGI was non existent, this epic film is the penultimate romance legend that continues to burn brightly."
1.0,gone_with_the_wind,"Sweeping, magnificent, timeless, and breathtaking in every way.

1.0,carol,"Todd Haynes' Carol is the height of details. Every prop, every glance, every sound - all add up to a delicate and enigmatic film that simply leaves you speechless. A warm film, despite the harsh, cold moral views of people in the 50s (when the film is set)."

0.0,carol,"If you are looking for a slow-as-molasses paced, artsy-fartsy movie about a sexual relationship between two women, that has barely any sex in it, then this movie is for you. Can't believe this movie merits an ""R"" rating. Very tame and pretty lame."
1.0,carol,"Pretty much my new favorite movie, or at least tied with my favorite, Sunset Boulevard (which is actually shown in Carol). Obssessed."
1.0,carol,"Carol is a beautifully crafted movie that infuses underrepresented themes into mainstream fare as best as any movie can to allow for a romance that is in equal parts sweet, sad, and, ultimately, inspiring."

0.0,carol,Good luck staying awake.
1.0,carol,"Extremely well acted, beautiful period piece. Mara Rooney's character reminds me of Audrey Hepburn at times (in appearance, anyhow).I didn't realize before I watched, but it is based on a book titled ""The Price of Salt"", which I am planning on reading due to the movie."
1.0,carol,"Stunning, heart wrenching, and so incredibly beautiful."
1.0,carol,"Shaped by Todd Haynes' fantastic direction and powered by a strong cast led by Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara, Carol lives up to its groundbreaking source material."
1.0,carol,"One of the most sophisticated love stories I've seen, especially with two female leads. The two actresses have incredible chemistry and convey volumes with just a look or a silence. I highly recommend it."
0.0,carol,"Borrrring. Maybe it was just me, but I didn't sense any sort of chemistry between the two. If anything, seemed like Mara's character was taken advantage of."
1.0,carol,A beautifully nuanced love story. Cate Blanchett is transcendent. Rooney Mara is a revelation. Excellent in every possible way.
1.0,carol,The best film of 2015.
1.0,carol,very good movie. intense writing and subject matter and the clothes were beautiful
1.0,carol,"WOW!!! This is stupendously emotional stuff. Stunning, heartbreaking, and (ultimately) hopeful. Todd Haynes is a tremendously talented director, and the cast (from top to bottom) is impeccable (as is Ed Lachman's magnificent cinematography!)."

1.0,carol,"Lovely movie, everything from the sound track to the cinematography was amazing."
1.0,carol,Outstanding performances by Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett underscored by Carter Burwell's moving soundtrack form the backbone of this elegant and transgressional 1950's love story.
0.0,carol,so boring and very slow.
1.0,carol,"Following in the foot prints of his ""Far From Heaven"", Todd Haynes proves once again that he is a master of exploring the forbidden, repressed sexuality of the 1950's. Beautifully designed and directed with near perfect acting from stars Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara in their Oscar nominated roles."
1.0,carol,My favorite movie and made me fall in love with the talents of Cate Blanchett
1.0,carol,"Way better than the 74% it's getting from audience. Usually I say audience is right and critics are wrong , but not this time. This movies has layers of drama to it and Cate Blanchette gives quite a performance."

1.0,carol,Exquisite. Magical. Breathtaking.
1.0,carol,"This was a well made movie of two women in an illicit relationship, and the cost of such a relationship in the fifties."
0.0,carol,Cate Blachett used to be one of my favorite actors - that is until I struggled through this movie. The dialog was painfully slow and uninteresting. If it had lasted any longer I might have killed myself. Glad I didn't pay theater admission.

1.0,carol,Simple and simply spectacular
1.0,carol,Amazing! Loved it! Beautiful story.
1.0,carol,a romantic relationship between two women in the early 1950's where these kinds of relationships were considered taboo and many thought having psychological treatments or threatening lawyers could get you to change your mind on whom you love or loved. excellent actors and storyline.
1.0,carol,A brilliantly written movie with two astounding performances from Blanchett and Mara : a moving tale of lesbianism in a wonderful and seemingly very restrictive setting of the 1950's New York.

0.0,carol,"As soon as I saw that this was a lesbian movie, I was not surprised by the overly high rating by the ""critics."" It's why I don't pay attention to critics."
1.0,carol,the most important movie in my life at the moment

1.0,carol,I really enjoyed. ð???
1.0,carol,"Outstanding, emotionally overwhelming movie that captures the essence of the early 1950s and the storms that erupt around falling in love.

1.0,carol,"Pure, intoxicating, and absolutely gorgeous. So quiet yet so full of life. Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara at their absolute best. It perfectly compliments and enhances the original novel The Price of Salt and vice versa."
1.0,carol,"Carol knocked me out. Cate Blanchett is overtaking Meryl Streep as my favourite actress, ever."
1.0,carol,Cate Blanchett is mesmerizing- she smolders in a subtle way. Bravo Cate and Haynes.

1.0,carol,"Excellent! Best film of 2015, no doubt."
1.0,carol,"An engaging story, but the cars, model trains, and dolls make it great. You gotta love a flick with scenes in a 1950s department store. The road scenes are not as eligant but wonderful in their own way."
1.0,carol,"Best film this year, Cate Blanchett delivers once again with Rooney Mara bringing an equally great performance. Perfect cinematography, a moving soundtrack, and a story that will break your heart."
1.0,carol,So well done! Love the 50's feel - all the through the window shots.
0.0,carol,More pretentious garbage. A pointless lesbian romance that bores you to tears. I have no clue how anyone could like this. The average moviegoer would agree it's a pile of crap.

1.0,carol,Especially want to see it because Kyle Chandler is in the movie.

1.0,carol,Only way to describe this film; exquisite!! Easily one of the best films of the year!
1.0,carol,"There is nothing about this film which is not beautiful. The acting, the setting, the costumes and the plot were utterly flawless. It was romantic but not in a wet Nicholas Sparks way. It was dramatic but not over the top. I honestly cannot fault it"
0.0,carol,so I'd say this is like watching paint dry but I hate to disparage paint... i though first that probably there was a good 10 minute movie in here trapped inside the body of a 2 hour movie.. but really that would really only be watching a smaller patch of paint dry.

0.0,gravity_2013,The worst script ever.
1.0,gravity_2013,"Grade - AWith some of the best CGI I've ever seen and good performances from Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, the only thing stopping 'Gravity' from becoming a perfect film is its script."
1.0,gravity_2013,Gravity is one of the greatest space movies I've ever seen. Its so realistic it seems to have really been filmed in space.
0.0,gravity_2013,"This movie was foolish and illogical. The only gravitational pull was the inexplicable draw of disasters to Sandra Bullock, despite the laws of physics and aerospace dynamics. I would give it a zero, but that won't register on this voting system."
1.0,gravity_2013,A very technical movie with much realistic technical input. The movie takes you as soon as your in space and warps you 96 minutes later that felt like 30 minutes.
0.0,gravity_2013,"This has to be the most overrated movie I've ever seen. Clooney and Bullock were so boring to watch that I completely lost interest. The scenery and cinematography were great, but the story/characters were lame throughout the entire film. 1/5"

0.0,gravity_2013,"TERRIBLE. I can't wrap my head around why people like this movie. Sure it ""looks cool"" with the whole space scene, but that's all it has to offer. It's boring, the story doesn't get you attached to the characters at all, and pretty much I wasted money on this. Not even worth renting in my book."

1.0,godfather_part_ii,Truly a great film with superb direction and a career defining performance from Robert De Niro.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Excellent performances all round. Sequel which is slightly better than the original.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The Godfather Part 2 is a brilliant crime drama that sets the stage of amazing sequels that top the original with two investing storylines about the hopeful tale of Vito Corleone of the past and the tragic tale of Michael Corleone
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"So riveting to see Michael Corleone's journey from when we first see him as the young war hero who isn't involved in the family business in The Godfather to the man at the end of this movie, who SPOILER ALERT, has his own brother killed. Once again, brilliant filmaking. Brilliant everything."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,This is the best made film of all time. The parallel stories of Vito and Michael Corleone are a brilliant combination of prequel and sequel all in one.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,best movie from the Godfather trilogy
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"A fantastic sequel to an amazing predecessor, 'The Godfather Part 2' benefits from more strong performances and another riveting story to keep audiences tuned into it's nearly 3 and half hour runtime."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Miraculously managing to both enrich and expand upon themes first broached by its predecessor, it certainly ranks among the very best of all sequels in American cinema."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The best sequel ever
1.0,godfather_part_ii,My personal favorite of the trilogy. To see De Niro playing young Vito intertwined with the descent of Pacino's Michael Corleone is just great.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Incredible great movie that follows the original
1.0,godfather_part_ii,That's a some spicy a meatball!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"The Godfather Part 2 is one of the best sequels of all time featuring great leads, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. Plus, the incredible supporting cast from Lee Strasberg and Michael V. Gazzo. You broke my heart, Fredo......."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,You feel contented after watching the movie....Good stuff!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Great but first one is still the best!! After watching this Al Pacino will become your new favorite actor
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"A sequel surpasses the original in many regards, The Godfather Part 2 is a haunting tale of betrayal, revenge and deception that is brought to life thanks to Francis Ford Coppala's amazing direction and the fantastic dual lead performances."

1.0,godfather_part_ii,Best sequel movie of all time!

1.0,godfather_part_ii,Movies like The Godfather and The Godfather Part II are simply not made anymore.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"It mirrors the original in a few ways, but it never duplicates it. With ""The Godfather Part II"" we excel beyond the story of the original film. Though, in my opinion, we never quite reach the cinematic heights."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Surprisingly better than the first film. The Godfather: Part II brings in one of the best performances of all time by Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, Godfather: Part II as well as Part I are the best gangster dramas of all time arguably."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The sequel can never be as good as the original...but this...this is close.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"La secuela de ""El padrino"" roza la perfección. Excelente."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"While Part 1 flew over my head a bit, Part 2 hit much closer to home. More visceral and cerebral, Part 2 is more epic."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"A great sequel / prequel to the original masterpiece. Although it's a long movie, the brilliant performance made it a must-watch for all movie goers."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Breathtaking, this deserves to be seen and re-seen, a masterpiece. How did Coppola get it so right after the first one ?"
1.0,godfather_part_ii,I can't choose if this film is better than The Godfather
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Three-and-a-half hours of tight plotting, beautiful camera work, perfect acting, unflinching character study, and an unbelievable sense of reality and scope. Ask yourself honestly: What's not to like?"
1.0,godfather_part_ii,In many ways I even like it more than the original. The last shot of the movie in my opinion is the greatest scene in cinematic history.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,A classic an amazing movie one of the greats
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Greatest sequel in the history of cinema and another exceptional masterpiece.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Outstanding and ambitious with excellent performances by the cast, The Godfather Part II can very well be considered one of the finest sequels ever made!!!"
0.0,godfather_part_ii,"Half of the time, the scenes of this film just felt like they're either out of place or just shown either too soon or too late, and just like the first film, overrated as f**k."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Thanks to strong and intelligent performances by Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, Francis Ford Coppola has directed not only the best sequel and best gangster film ever!:he has also directed the best movie ever! It's even much better than the first! A perfect 10 out of 10!"

1.0,godfather_part_ii,The greatest sequel ever made.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The Godfather part 2 is one of the greatest movie sequels ever made and one of director Francis Ford Coppolas greatest achievements in film and probably one of the greatest gangster movies of all time. Standing up along side the first godfather movie they make an incredible duo of essential cinema.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Another epic to the saga
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"The greatest ever sequel, even surpassing the original."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"All of the artistic elements of filmmaking come together here and make an unmistakable masterpiece. It is an epic centered on a family, and the love and the cruelty therein."

1.0,godfather_part_ii,"The best sequel ever made, hands down. The film that made Pacino a bona fide leading man."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,A sequel with equal!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"As good as the first, maybe even better. An excellent portrayal of the American Dream."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,This is one unique case of the sequel as good as the original movie
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"A better film than the first film, which I liked a lot, Al Pacino, is sharp, Robert De Niro is AMAZING as young Vito Corleone"
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"A sprawling, dense tale which builds on the greatness of the original. Full review later."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Could be the second greatest movie ever made, definitely greatest sequel ever made."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Maybe better than the first film, The Godfather: Part II packs a stronger punch of gang violence, storytelling, twists, family dynamics, and powerful acting. A clear definition of a what makes a great sequal"
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Maybe from a professional point of view the first Godfather is better but for me this is the best and favorite episode of the trilogy and therefore in my humble opinion it's one of the 3-5 best movies of all time.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"For me this is one of the five greatest American film, even better then the first. And the best written and acted motion picture ever."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"in my opinion the best of the trilogy of Godfather films, both Robert Di Niro and Al pacino at their best. great storyline and amazing acting. geniune classic!"

1.0,godfather_part_ii,One of the greatest movies ever!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"The great performances by everyone in the cast, the writing and directing propel this movie above all sequels and most movies in general. This movie raises the stakes from the first and made it even more tragic, but it is just as good as the first."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"There are very, very few sequels that are better than the original and this one stands at the head of the class. DeNiro comes into his own and Pacino deepens his Michael Corleone."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Second greatest mob movie ever( tied with Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas).
1.0,godfather_part_ii,This is my favorite one of Godfather Series.
0.0,godfather_part_ii,"Terrible. Utter was of time. The plodding dialog, the vacant plot, the ""I HAD AN ABORTION"" repeated 3 times to chase away the demons didn't work. It was a balled up pile of crap that shouldn't have been executed like Capt. McCluskey was in the first Godfather."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The greatest sequel of all time following the best film of all time and Pacino and De Niro bring it home.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,This was a great movie. In my opinion the greatest squeal to a movie ever.

1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Incredibly, memorable masterpiece!"
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Just as brilliant as part I!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,One of the best sequels in cinematic history.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Michael Corleone: ""If you don't listen to me and marry this man, you'll disappoint me"". The godfather: part 2 is one of the best squeal's ever made to cinema. The acting is outstanding and the characters feel like real people and not movie characters."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,and the best sequel in history goes to..
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Although it lacks in action and seemingly exciting parts as compared to its predecessor, The Godfather Part II is a storytelling masterpiece and a masterpiece of a film."

1.0,godfather_part_ii,Perfect... About as good as it gets.

1.0,godfather_part_ii,One of the best sequels ever made.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"The breathtaking cinematography continues in a sequel that stands alone and is just as huge, important and amazing as its predecessor. Fantastic performances and the mafia drama that we all love make this an amazing piece of art."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"It's without a doubt a masterpiece, and it's ambitious nature far out ways the minor misgivings I have with it. Viewed together, The Godfather and The Godfather Part 2 represent some of, if not the very best, American cinema."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Masterpiece that matches the first in quality film and excitement.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"My fave of the three,,,the back drop be amuse a character"

1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Not sure how it is possible, but but FFC's prequel/sequel is just as flawless as Part I -- but somehow manages to be the better of the two films. Perhaps one of the finest American films ever made."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Watched it for the 300th time tonight. Still perfect.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,the greatest sequel ever produced

1.0,godfather_part_ii,The best of the Godfather films in my opinion.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Expanding on the world of the previous installment, Godfather Part II has become the benchmark for all sequels, managing to introduce new plots all the while staying true to the heart of its predecessor."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Words cannot describe how good The Godfather is
1.0,godfather_part_ii,An inch away from being superior to the original.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"""Tony likes it when they go back to Italy. The crickets."" Well, Mr. Soprano is not alone, the scenes with Deniro in Italy and Al in Cuba are unforgettable. No other sequel has come so close to the glory of the first movie."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,I almost forgot what brilliant actors De Niro and Pacino once were! It breaks the heart.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,One of the old time greats.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Classic film, is very true story. I love watch this 1, 2 and 3. If I were you, best way watch from being by yourself and you will enjoy this show. Got to say this Man is a legend!"
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The second film in the Godfather saga transcends any biases of sequels by becoming a masterpiece itself - by artistically becoming level with the film before it.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"The best sequel ever? Very probably! Epic in scale and drama, this charts one man's rise and another man's descent"
1.0,godfather_part_ii,One of the best movies ever made
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The best sequel in film history. It's also better than the great original film.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"A fantastic film with incredible story, acting, and lighting. This is not a movie to be missed."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,No words need be said: Part II

1.0,godfather_part_ii,"The Best Sequel In This Trilogy,"
1.0,godfather_part_ii,As good or better than.the original Godfather. Both must be in your library.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,One of the greatest achievements in the history of cinema.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"it takes its predecessor and does what cinema should, rocket jumps off it and creates an even greater piece."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Me gusta un poco más que la primera, sólo un poco. Ambas son una chingonería."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,It s the best movie ever and the first was as good. Flawless.

0.0,godfather_part_ii,"What a lifeless, boring, self-indulged film! Woefully longer than necessary, this tedious junk is worth avoiding (notwithstanding its confusingly positive reviews and many accolades)."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Pacino's third best role!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Still to this day one of the finest movies made. Pure class. There was a time I could happily watch all 3 back to back. Despite the reviews of the 3rd film, the finale had every inch of class the first films had and would leave me wanting to play them again and again and..."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"A sequel to, arguably, the greatest film ever made would be difficult to pull off for any film maker, but Francis Ford Coppola uses his steady hand at direction to craft a film that is only a fingertip away from it's predecessor's magnificence."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Almost as good as the original. Poor Freddo Corleone - the second son. He should have had a more important role. Even as a baby he is a bit sickly. Very interesting to see how Vito becomes a Don as it would have been so easy for Vito to be only a Capo or even work for Fanuucio.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,A truly legendary film. There's a reason for that too.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"I take it back, THIS is the greatest mob movie of all time. As close to perfect as you can get!"

1.0,godfather_part_ii,the other one of the two best movies ever made. Which is better The Godfather or Godfather II? Very difficult to say they are both simply superb.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Superb film that's way before it's time! This was made in 1974! Overall a great film!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"I consider the film to be both a sequel and a prequel; to me, it is more better, and of course, darker, than its predecessor."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Aww Fredo Poor Fredo....lol
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Incredible filmmaking, the transformation of Michael Corleone is not only complete, but utterly mesmerising, and De Niro is in magnificent form too."

1.0,godfather_part_ii,One of the most spiritual movies ever made.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"I count the first and second Godfather movies to be the same movie, and the third one to be some strange sequel that didn't really need to happen. That being said, all the hype is worth watching the first two. Incredible."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Literally the second best thing to happen to cinema
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Superior to the original.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Best mob movie of all time. Two movies in one. Only movie that completes a trilogy with only two movies. Should have stopped here. It is rare that a sequel beats out its predecessor - especially this movies' predecessor.

1.0,godfather_part_ii,One of the 5 best movies of all-time and that's putting it conservatively. It may be the greatest film of all time. Pacino's performance is so subtle that it's haunting. The parallel between him and his young father is a dynamic that will never be matched.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Uma continuação tão boa e eficiente como o primeiro filme da trilogia!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The 2nd greatest gangster film ever made.

1.0,godfather_part_ii,"One of the best movies ever made, only second to the original Godfather. It is a movie that can be watched and still shocked and awed by the gruesome reality of twisted family loyalty."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Great classic movie!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"I had to change my rating because i did like this one more than the first, i thought 3 hours seriously? But this movie is so good i didn't mind at all.

1.0,godfather_part_ii,Godfather II is just as good as the first and gives an origin to Vito Corleone and the Corleone family. A true masterpiece
1.0,godfather_part_ii,A truly extracorporeal experience.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Perfect sequel to a perfect movie.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"As the sequel to a great mobster film, many expected this film to not achieve the hype of the original, those people were wrong. Dazzling sequel, with great performances by Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"One of the best sequels ever made. Blends both the rise and fall of the Corleone family. In my opinion, this film surpasses the original, simply because it brought itself to newer heights. It took risks and it succeeded. It's ambitious and powerful. It's a true piece of art and drama to admire."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,See comment on The Godfather
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"One of the few sequels that could be considered superior to the original, The Godfather, Part II matches and perhaps even outshines its legendary predecessor."

1.0,godfather_part_ii,"My all time favorite movie. If it's on, I'm watching it! 6 stars."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"It is truly an insult to call this film a sequel. It is much more of a companion piece to Part 1. Robert De Niro and Al Pacino both give mesmerizing performances, and Al Pacino more than deserved the Oscar. One of the greatest films of all time, and by far the greatest ""sequel"" of all time too."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The legacy continues.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Best of the trilogy. Pacino's performance as a morally desensitized Michael Corleone is amazing. De Niro's presence is definitely a plus.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Sequels really can be better than originals. Much better than I.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,This is a more complex and compelling tale of the Corleone Family. De Niro is incredible in his flashbacks as Vito and Pacino's struggle to maintain control of his family is so complex that it feels real.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,oh yeah and fuckin Robby de niro bitches!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"The greatest sequel ever made, period."

1.0,godfather_part_ii,"A perfect followup to the First Film, But it could stand on it's own. Worth every moment of watching it."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"I feel the best of the Godfather films. It intertwines two stories young Vito and Michael becoming a stronger, more powerful head of the family with designs on expanding his empire. Deniro and Pacino are great."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,greates mouvie franchise ever.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Everything I said about the first film can be applied here with twice the respect as this is the better film but has no actual bearing without seeing the first one. This is the main coarse of the trilogy and it certainly does not disappoint.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,An absolutely terrific piece of cinema history.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Sangre azul. Brillante como siempre.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"I didn't think it was possible, but I may have liked this one more.... whhaaat?? But no joke, the parallel journeys of Vito and Michael were fabulous and when I'm usually impartial to Robert De Niro, I think him (basically) impersonating Marlon Brando was just excellent."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Gr8t sequel to a classic and a classic in its own right I really canot say much about this epic that has not been said already.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Again, along with part I, the greatest American films ever."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Arguably better than Part 1.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Surpassed only by its predecessor, second greatest movie of all time. Period."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Sequel to the best mafia movie!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Oh wait. You throw DeNiro in there that's how. One of the greatest films ever made.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,I miss the Pacino we see in this movie. What happened to the subtle brilliance on display here? DeNiro is also awesome. The inevitable ending is like a punch to the gut. Excellent from start to finish.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"The rarest of things. The sequel outshines the orginal. The two Godfather movies are, to me, the pinnacles of what I go to the movies for in the first place."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Shows how criminals sometimes think themselves to be heroes. Shows the Italian experience in America
1.0,godfather_part_ii,One of the greatest movies of all time!!!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Possibly the best sequel ever made.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Surely the best ever sequel

1.0,godfather_part_ii,I like all the godfathers!!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,sencillamente brillante
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Definently as good if not better than the first Godfather movie. The story in this movie is competely original and Pacino is great as usual.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Despite the lack of Marlon Brando, Robert DeNiro takes over as a young Vito Corleone, immigrating to the U.S. in the early 20th century. This film serves as both a prequel, sequel, and conclusion to the Godfather films. The third one never happened, right?"
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Original rating Spring 2008.

1.0,godfather_part_ii,"A perfect followup to the First Film, But it could stand on it's own. Worth every moment of watching it."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Fredo getting capped on the lake, DeNiro taking down the neighborhood don during that parade, and so on and so on. Arguably better than the first and I will say that I like it more than the Godfather, which is awesome as well."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,See my Godfather review I reiterate what I said then.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Better than the first.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,A rare sequel that is just as good as its predecessor but trumps it in the raw intensity of its even more exciting subject matter. Excellent cinema... And one hell of an ending.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The best gangster film ever.... Part II was such an epic chapter i wished it was the last before Part III..... The history of Don Corleone is amazing with also the bigger rise of Michael Corleone.... The film is an epic and must be seen if your interested in gangster films......
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Probably the best of the trilogy.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,One of the greatest movies of all time. End of.

1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Great Part II, probably as better as the first one.The flashabacks give us a better idea how Vito Corleone began his ""business""Does loyalty really exist?Brother, brother-in-law, friends...Michael Corleone applies Machiavelli theories with success."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Equal to its predecessor 5/5
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The best one out of the three...this is in my top 10 of all times.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,I liked it jut as much as the first. This is actual art.

1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Not as good as the first one but is one of the few good sequels, in other words its "" the @$/! """

1.0,godfather_part_ii,"This movie, to me, is very entertaining showing present day and the past. It's very cool that they included Vito's rise to power."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Possibaly al pacino's best performance after scarface.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,the best of the bunch...De Niro should have got an oscar top 5 all time
1.0,godfather_part_ii,One of two instances where the sequel exceeds the original. 1: Irvin kirschner's Empire Strikes Back and 2: Godfather 2
1.0,godfather_part_ii,THE GREATEST SEQUEL EVER!!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Love, love, love it!"
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"As much as I hate to admit it, this movie expands (and improves upon) its predecessor. Filmed on a grand scale, with rich sepia tones, and seamlessly weaving between Michael's present and Vito's past, The Godfather Part II is a flawless masterpiece."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Probably the most perfect film ever made. If you've never seen a movie about the Mafia, start with this one!"
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Best in trilogy and probably best movie EVER!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Best Sequel To A Movie, EVER."

1.0,godfather_part_ii,Few example of a sequel surpassing our matching its predecessor.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The Second Greatest Movie Ever Made!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Absolutely stunning. A magnificent piece of art by FFC. Just as good (if not better) than the first one. Again unparalleled acting by all the cast members.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,A sequel even better than its original? Not impossible.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,I defy any male to dislike this classic great !!!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Best sequel made, and an excellent follow-up to the legendary predecessor. Features a very good and young Robert De Niro playing Vito Corleone, the patriarch of the family. Love the parallel storylines too!"
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Best sequel ever!! Perfection again.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Far darker and even more ambitious in scale than the original.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,My favorite of the movies
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"The only sequel to win best picture oscar; it continues the story of the original. Brando is gone, but his character is played as a young man by Robert DeNiro. With an appearance by method actor teacher Lee Strasberg, who taught many great actors. Starring Al Pacino, Diane Keaton and Robert Duvall."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,the best movie ever but part 2 decreased sense of part 1
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"""I can handle things. I'm smart, not like everybody says, not dumb. I'm smart, and I want respect!"" Possibly the best acted scene of all time?"
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Robert De Niro. That is all
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Nothing can be so much better then a sequel that depicts lives of two dons of different eras.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,cmon...like u have to ask
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Not quite the original, but Pacino's still great"
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"part 2 was better than one.. though one wa needed. Godfather 2; helped explain the history.. the gradual gravitaion towards Al""s Dynasty Classic"

1.0,godfather_part_ii,A mesmerizing sequel that does The Godfather justice and a little extra.

1.0,godfather_part_ii,i LOVE THE ACTING SKILL IN THIS MOVIE
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"great film the only problem I had with it, it was just too long, 3 hours and 20 mins is too long for me, after 2 hours and 40 mins I was getting fed up, it was a good film and it was directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It starred Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Robert De Niro"
1.0,godfather_part_ii,La segunda mejor de las 3.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,How they made a film that was arguably even better than the magnificent first installment is still a mystery...deservedly the only sequel ever to have won the best picture Oscar...
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The Godfather 2 is in many ways superior to the first Godfather and is definitely one of the best sequels ever made. The ending is perfect and there honestly wasn't a need for part 3.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Al Pacino ups his game as he officially becomes the Don of the Corleone Crime Family. It is a sequel rarely matched, breaking a lot of records with its accolades."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,My favorite movie of all time! This one of those rare films were the sequel is better than the original.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,I have viewed this trilogy several times. I will never tire of it.

1.0,godfather_part_ii,No importa cuantas veces la veo siempre me conmueve.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Rober De Niro at his best.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Coppola's second classic of the 70s.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The Godfather and The Godfather Part 2 should be placed next to each other in the movie hall of fame for best one-two punch of filmmaking genius..
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The movie will make your emotions run like crazy. There's just too much to respect about this film.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,i liked this one also...goes back and forth ..took talent of al pacino..robert duvall and schowcased them...another must see
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Al Pacino is simply mind blowing.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"A sequel worthy of itself. This movie is another one of my all-time favorites, just like its predecessor."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,What a bliss to get to see the timeless classic on restored DCP copy on a major screen! Filmmaking at its best. Coppola's remarkable achievement in film history. Flawless ensemble. And so on and so on.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Darker and wider than part 1, Godfather part 2 is perhaps the most successful sequel to date, combining themes of a wide range to encapsulate the dark nature of its characters and the business of immorality."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,I Like All The Godfather Movie's !
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"muy pocas secuelas son dignas de sus antecesoras, Coppola complementa su trayectoria con esta nueva joya, a destacar la interpretaciÃ³n de Robert De niro"
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Pacino and Niro at their best!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Mr. Vincent Canby.... seriously.... WTF???
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Better than the first, but only by THIS much. A true classic in every sense of the word."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,A story. A Saga. An Epic. Better than the first. Pacino is riveting even without lines. A masterpiece.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"The sequel to one of the best movies ever made, Godfather II launches even deeper within the intricacies of the mob while showing off great insight within Michael's psyche in comparison with his father's rise."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Better than the first. . . or just a continuation of the inherent greatness?
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"If I could give this 6 stars I would.... in my opinion, it beats the first one..."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,better than the 1st wich is rare.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,This was my favorite of the three movies and that doesn't happen often if not ever
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Better than the original
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The Greatest Film of all time apart from Lord Of The Rings
1.0,godfather_part_ii,better than the first!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The second part of the Godfather may be just as good as part one...nevertheless...this is probably the best sequel to a movie that has ever been made
1.0,godfather_part_ii,It somehow manages to surpass the first. Such a great movie in every way imaginable.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,It is The Dark Knight of its time.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,YOUNG VITO NECESITO HABLAR MAS
1.0,godfather_part_ii,even better than its predecessor...stunningly well written and even more well conceived
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Wow - excellent cast - gave a view of life before the 1st one - will see the 3rd one and then thank my friends for recommending them :)
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"a great sequel, larger than the the first one, and the sets, the music and the performances, especially al pacino and robert deniro are just perfect..."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,It's a masterpiece.... the greatest possible sequel to the greatest movie! Loved it.. 100% Fresh.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,So which one is better: Part 1 or Part 2?
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"An extreme rarity, a follow up movie that is at least as good as its predecessor, if not better. A fabulous prequel and sequel in one that shows a more (and less) human side to the family. Again, not a wasted scene or even shot, brilliant."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,How the system your can kill your soul. Criminal thinking at it's finest.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Just as good at the first one. Brilliant!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,As equal as the first.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Pacino is amazing in the sequal as is De Niro. Not quite as great as the first film but still extraordinary.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,best of the trilogy.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Just as good as the first one!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Amplifies and Illuminates the Original--
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Not quite as good as the original but still a very acceptable sequel, which is certainly saying something. Fredo dying still doesn't make up for Sonny's death, though, even though he probably did deserve it."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Best movie ever: Part two.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"This is one of the best, if not the best, sequels of all times - absolutely brilliant!"
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Part II of one of the most quintessential movies in the history of films!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,As good as the first.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Better than the first. That's right, I said it."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The best sequel ever made!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Simply put: the best sequel and an unbeatable crime drama. It manages the nearly-impossible feat of besting the first film and is probably amongst the best films ever crafted.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Just as good if not better than its predecessor. A bit darker, but still amazing."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,second best movie of all times
1.0,godfather_part_ii,it ll be hard for any sequel to live up to this one...
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"""Keep your friends close and your enemies closer"" - Don Michael Corleone (Al Pacino)"
1.0,godfather_part_ii,One of the best flashbacks of all time at the beginning of this marvellous sequel. Something too amazing to be done again.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,the godfather part 1 is better
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Amazing, but about .0000000000001 is how much better the first one then this one"
1.0,godfather_part_ii,my favorite godfather.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Great sequel that just adds on to the first ones greatness. De Niro was great and was very important to the story which I felt made the film more interesting. Everyone must see the Godfather 1 and 2 before they die.~ Average Movie Guy
1.0,godfather_part_ii,I think it's so much better than the original.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Robert De Niro as a young Vito Corleone!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,almost as good as the last one
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"The Godfather Part II shows as much perfection as its predecessor. Maintaining a non linear story with a strong performance from Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, The Godfather Part II is truly the greatest sequel ever made."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Al Pacino really came into his own in II. What other directors have ever won back to back best picture awards with the original and the sequel? None that I know.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Too good to describe. Just watch it!!! But watch part 1 first.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Better than the original. Robert Deniro and Al Pacino are both amazing in what probably shoud've been the last Godfather movie made.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The sequel from one of the best movies ever made. I can't say which one is better between part 1 and part 2
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"One of only 3 sequels I know of (the other two being ""Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Batman Returns"") That were actually BETTER than the original film. Absolutely excellent. May be a bit too slow-moving for viewers under 40."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"One of the greatest movies of all time, the sequel to 1972's The Godfather benefits from the incredibly talented cast, which includes superb performances from Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, and a denser, action-packed plot which fully justifies the 200-minute screen time."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Personally, it was better than it's predecessor. Pacino should have gone home with best actor. The Academy got it wrong that year. Too many scenes that will stick to you for the rest of your memory."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The benchmark for making sequels. If only they'd followed up sooner with Part III; it may have been a masterpiece.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Wow. That's all I'll say.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Two amazing stories of a father and a son in one movie. Couldn't get better than this.
0.0,godfather_part_ii,Robert Deniro's performance elevates an otherwise shitty movie
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"incredible,touching, mind blowing acting, the godfather part 2 is without question a all time classic, just like his predecessor."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,beautiful movie with beautiful backstory. one of those movies you can flip to any day and start watching and rediscovering again
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Just as good if not better than Part 1
1.0,godfather_part_ii,who said sequels aren't better than the original?
1.0,godfather_part_ii,DVD Godfather Box Set
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Hablar de segundas partes es complicado, mas que nada porque no siempre son buenas, pero indiscutiblemente, la segunda parte del Padrino es superior y mas densa y oscura que la primera. Una obra clásica que vivirá para siempre."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Three hours and twenty minutes!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,SECOND BEST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Inclusion of De Nero is definitely a high point but the ultimate attraction remains Pacino..A great movie. One of those movies u should watch before u die.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Still debating whether or not this is better than the first.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"One or Two? One, barely."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,zo'n films kome nooit meer trg
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"La meilleure suite de tous les temps du meilleur film de tous les temps, tout simplement. Un pur chef-d'oeuvre de Francis Ford Cappola qui frappe encore dans le mille avec sa poignée d'acteurs talentueux. Brillant."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"One of the few sequels that ever matched its predecessor, this back-and-forth film follows Puzo's work amazingly and just strengthened a franchise that will ever live in American film lore."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Even better than the original. Amazingly directed, beautifully told, and excellently acted."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Al Pacino's acting in the film is far more superior as the ruthless don than his outsider character from the first film.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Probably my most favorite movie. Godfather II is partly based on the unused material from the first book and partly is new story by Coppola and Puzo. Needless to say GDII movie surpasses both original movie and book.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Just say three Hail Mary's and this movie is great.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,One of the best movies ever (along with Part II). Part III is so-so.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Fredo is a piece of shit.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"A perfectly constructed, supremely acted, superbly written elegy. No American movie has ever topped this masterpiece. It is not only the greatest sequel ever made, but also probably my favorite movie."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Just classic, in every way."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,A great American epic! Superior to the first!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"This is one of the greatest movies ever made. Even with the first movie being as great as it was, amazingly, Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puza were able to top themselves."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"My favourite of the serie. The cast is simply flawless. Vito corleone's story with De Niro, bullseye."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,And it is just the second one.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Maybe the best movie ever made!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"This is perhaps the greatest sequel ever made. This movie is amazingly good. I liked this one better than part 1 but I can not decide if it is better or not; either way, both movies are perfect."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,So good they had to do it again!!! The scene at the end where Pacino is sitting in the backyard is chilling!!!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,parts one and two are fantasic...part III blows.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"If Coppola had aborted this film, I would have slapped him like Pacino slapped Keaton."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The studios don't make movies like this anymore :(
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Great sequel to a great movie.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"The second obviously can't stand alone without the first or third but remains my favourite Godfather. I like the development of Michael's character at this point and enjoy the appearance of De Niro as Don Corleone, love it."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The sequel to one of the best movies ever made. And one of the best sequels ever made.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"As good as the first! I just wish they had been able to afford Marlon Brando. Oh well, Robert DeNiro is a suitable replacement."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Pacino and De Niro, probably some of their best performances ever."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The second chapter of the Godfather Trilogy!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,the third best drama ever made
1.0,godfather_part_ii,More Perfect than the original! taught me not to abort Michael's baby..... anyone named Michael for that matter!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"The Godfather Part 2 is just as compelling and structurally excellent as the original, though not quite as groundbreaking."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"I consider the second part deeper then the first one. It's where we know the way Michale Corleone is, he's not a Godfather as the way his father used to be, he's just tough man."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"De Niro and Pacino, what more do you really need to say"
1.0,godfather_part_ii,How can a sequel get better than this?
1.0,godfather_part_ii,As Good As The First One.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"The most accomplished and well made sequel of all time. Winning 6 oscars was a great achievement, It enlarge in every circumstances from The Godfather, and Al Pacino has delivered a trend setting performance, which will always be remembered by the movie lovers."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Very witty, very smart, and funny movie. Didn't really make a huge impact on me but liked it nonetheless. Might have to re-watch it."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Great movie, Jack Benny perfect ham and Carole Lombard is always great."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"One of the top 10 comedies of all time. Jack Benny as Hamlet, directed by the great Ernst Lubitsch, one of Carole Lombard's last roles. The inspiration for Hogans Heroes. The immortal line ""What Hitler did to Poland, he did to Shakespeare!""."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"To Be or Not to Be is a relevant and layered satire, a blend of dark humor and sight gags, of comedy and morality."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Laughing at Hitler 25 years before Mel Brooks and making political suicide gags 21 years before Stanley Kubrick. I see you, Herr Lubitsch."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Laugh out loud funny when ""The Great Dictator"" or the remake struggled. Seek this one out!"
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,A comedy about totalitarian political system.
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"""To Be Or Not To Be"" was one of the greatest films made during World War II. Jack Benny and Carole Lombard were perfectly cast, however my vote goes to the greatest scene stealer of them all, Sig Rumann, in the role of ""Zo They call me Concentration Camp Erhardt?"""
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,A must-see. A film lampooning Hitler to great comedic effect in 1942. Absolutely incredible.

1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,The greatest comedy ever
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"To think that a German director made this in 1942 is incredible. Ernst Lubitsch was laughing in the face of tragedy. Although serious themes are dealt with and mild peril is encountered, I was in stitches throughout. The Lubitsch Touch is in full effect."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Hilarious movie, one of the funniest films I've ever had the pleasure of watching."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,Ernst Lubitsch at his best.
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,a classic comedy unknown to many
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,Amazing blend of drama satire and comical silliness all around a tragic wartime story. Lombard was the beat female comic of the day and Jack Benny pulls of his only worthy movie role of a lifetime.
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,Lubitsch somehow finds a tone that perfectly balances comedy and gripping tension as you wonder how the characters will get out of predicament after predicament. Downright hilarious.
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"favorite line: heil myself....  ""why haven't you seen this really funny film yet?"" ....THAT is the question!"
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Otrolig glÃ¶d och udd med humor Ã¤r minst lika svart som ss-uniformen. Jack Bennys ""Heil myself"" som Hitler Ã¤r ju en omedelbar klassiker. Men detta Ã¤r lÃ¥ngt mycket mer Ã¤n bara en catch phrase-komedi."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,Esta comedia es más moderna en su timing y su estructura que muchas de las actuales. Una verdadera genialidad.
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"A daring, and ruthlessly funny, Nazi satire."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"It's certainly one of the finest comedies ever to come out of Paramount, the allegations of dubious taste missing the point of Lubitsch's satire - not so much the general nastiness of the Nazis as their unforgiveable bad manners"
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Made at the height of World War II, this satirical comedy is a perfect vehicle for Benny."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"glorious, unlike the latest tarantino wankfest."

1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,We should all cry for living in a cinema world without Lubitsch the Prince Charming.
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,This must have pissed old Adolph off some what.A corking comedy and Benny was never better.A propoganda masterpiece....Heil Me!
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Hilarious, clever and ultimately relevant. But the directing is just incredible. The cuts, the structure, the timing and the pacing, even if the movie was awful it would be a pleasure to watch."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,Most folks know the Mel Brooks version but this is the orginal. If you HAVEN'T watched the Mel Brooks one watch this one FIRST!!! Mel is great and all but for a great old flick this is one of the best!! Comedy!! ACTION!! Nutzi's!!

1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"A brilliantly funny comedy from Ernst Lubitsch, portraying the oppression of the European countries under Hitler's rule while simultaneously reveling in the freedom to make fun of the Nazis to its heart's content. Wonderfully funny, greatly acted and marvelously written. Just a superb film."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"""Heil Myself."" A truly classic film. I saw it today on TCM and fell in love with it. Apparently just after filming the Japanese bombed pearl harbor. Actress Carole Lombard then became a activist selling war bonds but died in a plane crash. This was her final film."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,Undoubtedly one of the most brilliant comedy classics of all-time. Here is the master Ernst Lubitsch at his best. Carole Lombard and Jack Benny are just magnificent. Truly one of the greatest scripts in the history of cinema.

1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"I just discovered this movie recently, and I absolutely love it. A group of Polish actors foil a Nazi plot during WWII, but that's just the backdrop for a screwball comedy perfectly suited for Carole Lombard. Jack Benny is also great as her hammy husband."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Magistral Lubitsch. Y la escena del monologo de Hamlet, para llorar de risa hasta que se le sequen a uno los ojos. Obra Maestra."

1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"A masterpiece of an anti-Nazi satire comedy. Funny and intelligent. Every funny scene in this film has a clever twist. What other director has the sophisticated touch that Lubitsch has? He is truly a genius with elegant style!!! And of course, Carol Lombard is divine in this film."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,Schlicht und ergreifend genial. Keinesfalls zu verwechseln mit Mel Brooks' Remake...
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"A later Lubitsch, but not a lesser one.  Still hilarious and, one must say, rather brave, aping Hitler and Nazism right at the start of America's involvement in the war.  Plus, it stars Jack Benny. JACK BENNY. How fucking cool is that?"
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"without question, of the greatest movies of all time. the lubitsch touch is in full effect! the entire cast is simply brilliant and everyone delivers with top comedic timing especially jack benny (why didnt he act more!) and the resurgently popular carole lombard. quotable and hysterically funny."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,Just watch it. You'll understand.
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,Superby Lubitsch comedy bravely playing fast-and-loose with Hitler barely a year after Pear Harbour. A stunning achievement in which the laughs keep coming despite - or because of - how serious the jeopardy seems to be.

1.0,chinatown,Neo Noir Masterpiece.
1.0,chinatown,"This 1974 film directed by Polansky is one of the greatest expressions of the neo noir films. An excellent screenplay and a portentous performance of Jack Nicholson. Moreover, without having a happy end it makes more admirable."

1.0,chinatown,One of the most entertaining films of all time. The film super glues you to the screen and once the film ends you'll be yearning for side stories from the brutally shady & unpredictable chinatown of the 1930's. You'll also wish there were a JJ Gittes comic book/animated series. So good.
1.0,chinatown,"Well, Roman Polanski is probably my favorite director. This is a movie is unlike any of his other works. This really is a masterpiece, like most of his films before this one. I guess that's Roman Polanski for you."

1.0,star_trek_11,excellent reset! I hope we get a TV series based on this new Star Trek universe!
1.0,star_trek_11,Perfect for what it was. A much needed reboot for a great franchise that ended on such a low note. Lens flares everywhere!
0.0,star_trek_11,"Hmmm... Where do I start with this? Slow, boring and predictable. I literally fell asleep when it got up to an hour. Very disappointing. And as for the sequel, no thanks. I'll take a pass."

1.0,star_trek_11,"J.J.Abrams made another box office bestseller movie called Star Trek. Star Trek has it all, good graphic's, best actor performance ,and sound quality that would blow your mind. This is a movie you don't want to miss out on."
1.0,star_trek_11,best film of the year simply spectacular
1.0,star_trek_11,Just simply fantastic. Abrams is a genius. The character development is just seamless. The way the movie starts sucks you in for the entire movie and makes you want more and more. Talk about an attention getter.
1.0,star_trek_11,Wonderful front story on how all the characters came to meet and evolve. Great action sequences and special effects.
1.0,star_trek_11,re-inventing that adds without taking away from the star trek lore
1.0,star_trek_11,one of the best sci-fi films i have ever seen
1.0,star_trek_11,You either love or hate the new ones. I am a huge fan of Gene Rodenberry's original and The Next Generation series. I really enjoyed this installment and thought they selected the cast well.
1.0,star_trek_11,I really like the direction J.J. Abrams took with this - opens it up to a lot of new adventures.
1.0,star_trek_11,Ever seen a black hole swallow an entire planet starting from the core outward? Well this is probably the closest you'll ever get to that. Harold is in it with a high tech katana that folds and unfolds. Flawless special effects and orgasmic action. Need I say more?
1.0,star_trek_11,"This new, younger, and action packed version of the franchise shows what you can do with a strong story, a young and new cast, and even better than Star Wars prequel special effects."
1.0,star_trek_11,"Not a Star Trek fan, but this movie felt so accessible and entertaining, I enjoyed it very much and will have to keep an eye out for sequels."

1.0,star_trek_11,"Maintaining the charm of the classic series while still reinventing it for a new generation, Star Trek is a brilliant example of smart, popcorn entertainment."

1.0,star_trek_11,Great film!! One of the best of the year!! Makes Star Trek exciting!!
1.0,star_trek_11,The best film of 2009 in my opinion. This revamp made Star Trek more mainstream allowing all to enjoy this amazing world.
0.0,star_trek_11,"The worst hack and slash ever done to a noble franchise. Please, fire these writers. This was clearly written by men who hate Star Trek fans."
1.0,star_trek_11,"I don't think there is a single boring moment in Star Trek (2009). It's a consistently entertaining film that never stops to breath, which is okay considering the fact that the film has a free flowing & breezy vibe. One of the best action/adventure films of the 2000's, hands down. It's great fun."
1.0,star_trek_11,"An incredible production to put a fresh twist to the well-known franchise. Well acted, scripted, directed, and visually stunning. A must-see for Star Trek fans and those skeptical alike."

1.0,star_trek_11,"Se sai bem em tudo... Do ótimo enredo e personagens bem construídos, passando por efeitos especiais fantásticos até o espírito original da saga. J.J. Abrams merece aplausos por dar nova vida á série com louvor."
1.0,star_trek_11,just because it's Zachary Quinto...
1.0,star_trek_11,"Liked this in spite of myself! Always hated Star Trek growing up, and after the Vegas Hilton fiasco...let's just say I'm not a fan. LOL But this caught me completdly off-guard and made a fan of me. Kudos!!"
1.0,star_trek_11,J.J Abrams reboots the star trek franchise beautifully.
1.0,star_trek_11,An action packed and visually stunning re-imagining of the classic franchise.
1.0,star_trek_11,Was pretty good!!! ^_^
1.0,star_trek_11,"A great prequel, with lots of action and background to some of the characters. Fantastic how the leads capture the same behaviour as the original actors. A must."
1.0,star_trek_11,hands down my favorite movie of all time. only closely followed by its sequel
1.0,star_trek_11,"Not only a sort of reboot but also a sequel of the previous movies, this is without a doubt a welcomed return and a perfect way to introduce new fans without losing the old Trekkies, filled with nostalgia, very well driven characters and well orchestrated action."
1.0,star_trek_11,Amazing. Freaking awesome.
1.0,star_trek_11,Fell in love with going to movies all ovet again thanks to this film. it was a real treat to see on the big screen.

1.0,star_trek_11,Great adaption from old tv series
1.0,la_grande_illusion,my favorite film ever
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"The best foreign film I've watched, thus far. Its so good that writing a review would take too much time, but let me just say this: This is a film EVERY person should watch and a film that will still be important a CENTURY from now."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Erich von Stroheim was as always superb in this movie. Thank you Jean Renoir for this beautiful film with such a great message.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the most crucial and humanist of films.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Simple yet emotionally complex. An anti-war story about patriotism, war, brotherhood and humanity. La Grande Illusion served as an influence to many future filmmakers dealing with the topic of war. Sad, funny and moving all at once!"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the best movies of all time. I've never had such a strong urge to watch a movie a second time right after seeing it.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A terrific masterpiece that should be known and watched by everyone. Its important anti-war message, along with powerful topics such as friendship and humanity, makes this film an essential viewing experience. A masterful classic that will continue to be admired and studied in years to come."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Greatest Foreign Language anti-war movie, aside from being a great movie on its own terms. Admirable restoration!"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Like All Quiet on the Western Front, this film is still one of the best war films ever made."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"One of the few films that rank among the best of any art form. Shocking and brave for it's time, the progressive ideology of the film is more progressive than most films out today."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"An incredible film, with such a brilliant message and such a well thought out manner of portraying it that it deserves its place as one of the greatest films ever made."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Classic perfect film. Old film that is entertaining enough for modern filmgoers to enjoy throughly. For those who may want to watch the film more studiously pay attention to how the film deals with its major themes (race, class, war)."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"An arrestingly humanistic, anti-war masterwork, in part thanks to the camera's light and calm motion."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,It's a beautiful film. Not just for the way it looks but what it says & how it moves.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,There's a reason this is always listed among the best film's ever made. It is. The restoration brings Renoir's perfect cinematography to new clarity. Von Stroheim's performance is quietly elegant. You cannot call yourself a film fan until you see this.

1.0,la_grande_illusion,"simple story with characters both subtle and heartfelt, it's timeless, moving, and easy to love."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,A classic that moves one on many levels. See it if it's playing nearby.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Jean Renoir aims high with this film. Renoir exceeds this and he doesn't miss a beat. After you watch this film, you feel so emotionally drained. Outstanding achievement in telling the story and cinematography. Just as political as it is emotional. My personal 2nd favorite film ever."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Brilliant film. Nuff said
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Admit it: you wish you could be as cool as Jean Gabin.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,The 75th Anniversary restoration is absolutely beautiful. Grand Illusion is a powerful and unforgettable film.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,My first (movie) Criterion that I purchased. How can a guy forget his first?
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Le monde change devant nos yeux. Film absolument superbe!
1.0,la_grande_illusion,[i]Review coming soon.[/i]
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Probably the most fun I've ever had with an anti-war film. Renoir's film is rich in flair, thematic material and humor, and earns every right to be considered one of the most important films of all time. Casa Blanca, took more than a few cues from this."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Perhaps not Renoir's most radical film, but in my opinion his most moving, about the dislocations created by war and the at times futile struggles of men to stay somehow connected--to friends, to social classes, to lost conventions."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Oh sweet Jesus, so much deep focus. Such a good story. Such great directing. Sublime acting. I LOVE IT!"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Sublime, serene, and elegiac. I watch this once a year and that may not be enough. I'm not sure what's more sad: the horrors of war, or trying to place a gentleman's agreement on top of the whole mess. A true 10-star masterpiece."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Great Jean Renoir war film about officers and the death of the nobility in World War 1. Renoir is one of the best directors of all time, and this is one of his best movies."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,ExperiÃªncia cinematografica cinco estrelas. Um filme que quase desapareceu da histÃ³ria do cinema mundial.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A beautiful, subtle, humane, enormously influential look at war, the people who fight on both sides, and a system of the world that was inexorably on its way out, for better and for worse."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Renoir is easily one of the greatest directors of all time
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Jean Renoirs La Grande Illusion er intet mindre enn ett tidlÃ¸st mesterverk! Jean Gabin, Pierre Fresnay og Erich Von Stroheim spiller hovedrollene i dette episke verket om vennskap og aristokrati. En klassiker!"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Grand Illusion is a timeless peace of cinema forever ensured to be remembered generation by generation. It`s just a remarkable film you have to experience for yourself.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"I love that the original P.O.W film is the one that manages to break the stereotypes, the WW1 setting also adds an extra dimension awesome"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,c juste trop grandiose!!!
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A magnificent film which questions the very nature of our social and ethnic divisions. Offers in the grimmest of contexts, when all the divisive prejudices have sunk along with all prior notions of civilization, the possibility for a new model of pacifism, humanism and egalitarianism to emerge."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Very exciting and extremely ingenious
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"It's a curious film. The title is purposely misleading. The ""illusion"" doesn't have to do with escaping from any POW camp."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A very layered, and thoughtful work. Fantastic use of a disjointed 3-act structure. I think I prefer to The Rules of the Game. 9.5/10"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Never have I seen an Anti-War film so impressionable; one of the deepest, most critical films of its century."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,one of the 10 greatest films I have ever seen...
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A intelligent and subtle way of expressing the fear of war through the people effected by it. Some directors today still feel righteous to show heroism during war, where in fact Renoir's anti war message is considerably more apt."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Renoir is the bomb. A prison camp film from WWI with a unique perspective. Finely acted and thought provoking.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,There are some minor flaws but mostly this is incredible. Good on him for making it right before WWII. It's shocking how much The Great Escape steals from this movie.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"My favorite Renoir, and starring the great Jean Gabin and Erich von Stroheim"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,A fantastic war film that has had a clear influence on nearly every other escape movie since.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Fantastic film from Renoir! I was shocked and a bit moved by the scene where the prisoners of war find pleasure in looking at women's clothing. Just one of many scenes that make this a rare and unbeatable war film.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"There are so many good things about this movie. The cast is perfect for a start. The guts Renoir showed in making it. The arc of the story. The triumph and tragedy of it's characters. And Erich Von Stroheim, what a guy!"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,The best french movie ever made?
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"The first ""P.O.W. Escape"" movie, and by far the best"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the best films ever.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Truly powerful, poignant, and moving."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"der film hat mir sehr gefallen, will mehr filme von renoir sehen. erich von stroheim ist ja auch in sunset bv."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,It's amazing how real this movie feels.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,I had forgotten how flabbergastingly great this thing is. Just astonishing. Renoir's introduction is a must.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,I saw this in my TFM class and it's one of the oldies but goodies. Really romance driven.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A beautifully optimistic tribute to human nature in the face of the tragic idiocy (or ""grand illusion"") of nationalism, class, ""duty"", politics and everything else that divides us."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,An amazing film with some very amusing moments. A classic must-see Jean Renoir film!
1.0,la_grande_illusion,a testament to humanity in the midst of war
0.0,la_grande_illusion,"When you really sit down and talk about it, World War is silly, don't you think? I mean, instead of fighting we could, I don't know, be drinking wine or eating cheese . . ."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"The most unique WWI film I have seen. No attempt to show the trenches, but the relationships of people. I enjoyed, hmm-mmm."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"I hadn't seen this in years! This is a newly restored version, and it's poetry. Lots of movies demonstrate that war is hell, but this is a rare movie that says that war can bring out the best in an individual."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the greatest films ever made!
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Nice little ""surviving adversity"" film with a sorta/kinda happy ending. Oh, wait...what's this subplot about class? Or antisemitism? Or relationships transcending politics/class/language? WTF! Why is all this serious stuff in my entertainment?"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"If this isn't the greatest movie ever made, it's certainly in the top 20. There is layer upon layer of subtext and social commentary in this film, on top of a pretty gripping story. It's much more than a POW film, and it's worth seeing at least once in a lifetime."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,A great anti war film. GW would ban it if he could...
1.0,la_grande_illusion,the great classic. everyone should have seen it
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the best movies of all time!
1.0,la_grande_illusion,You've heard of this for a reason. It's one of the best films ever made. It's silly to say anything more. But it certainly holds up more than well.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A very nice, fun film. It deals with everything from war to class to race in a prison camp environment. A classic brilliant film."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Consistently number one or two on my list of greatest films of all time. Pure cinematic poetry. Unforgettable.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"An amazing, deeper-than-expected film by Jean Renoir. It's a complex look at war, and the fracturing and bringing together that it is capable of. Humor is wisely weaved in, and with a superb cast, this film tackles the war with whole-hearted conviction."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A beautiful film in many ways. Renoir's constantly moving camera provides the film with a wonderful kineticism. I was surprised at how funny the film was, which works in its favor and makes its anti-war message that much more poignant."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"My favorite movie of all time. Probably one of the earlier anti-war films, it takes place, mostly, in a prisoner-of-war camp during WWI, and depicts the class struggle on both sides of the conflict."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Most nuanced war movie I've ever seen. Incredible.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,un chef d'oeuvre : humour a la Audiard avant Audiard et humanité en temps de guerre. magnifique
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"If we through Bogart and Gable in this bad boy we have the Beatles of early sound film. This all star cast and amazing director combine powers to create a film that has stood the test of time for over 70 years. Erich von Stroheim is the coolest sad, old man in the history of cinema... maybe."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,The 86% of people 'not interested' in seeing this film should be ashamed.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Something that great films have in common is that they stretch across more than 3 acts. There is a reason why most critics include this film in their 'top 5' list of greatest films.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the greatest war movies ever.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"fabulous. lots of later 50s war films (great escape, colditz story) are copies of this. class, ethics, camaraderie, friendship, love. in the usual, surprisingly 'modern' style of all Renoir's films and the French 'c'est la vie' realistic attitude. I BLOODY LOVE RENOIR FILMS"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the best movies ever made
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Probably the best war movie ever. Steve McQueen's ""Great ""Escape"" was a dumbed-down version of this film. There are class struggles, castle escapes, WWI tearing apart Europe, solitary."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Absolument merveilleux sur le plan humain.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A movie for all time about man-made caste systems, ethnic and country divisions. Questions the true nature of honor."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Powerful movie... one of the 3 best films I've ever seen (with Citizen Kane and The Godfather Pt. II). Gabin is incredible! I used to have the Criterion Collection DVD of this film; sadly, I sold it a couple of years ago."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Hitler called it Cinematic public enemy number one. Amazing stuff, heavily borrowed by Casablanca but a richer film that is the true father of all anti-war movies"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A magnificent film which questions the very nature of our social and ethnic divisions. Offers in the grimmest of contexts, when all the divisive prejudices have sunk along with all prior notions of civilization, the possibility for a new model of pacifism, humanism and egalitarianism to emerge."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,AWESOME! I loved it. I think Professor Dine-Young for having film class watch it because sadly I would have never picked it up on my own.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,the passing of the old guard
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A war film where only 1 shot is fired. This, Paths Of Glory & The Deer Hunter are the finest films about the absurdity & horror of war --if you ask me."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A grand masterpiece with a great trio of actors, Jean Gabin, Fresnay and Stroheim. A must see anti-war movie."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Ultimately through the visuals of the endless, snowcovered, Swiss Alps Renoir teaches the viewer that the borders humans create are not recognized by nature, but rather just a grand illusion."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"""Frontiers are an invention of men. Nature doesn't give a hoot."""
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Le film pacifiste par excellence. Il raconte la fin d'un monde, prophetise les horreurs de la deuxieme guerre mondiale qui s'annoncait a l'epoque, tout en affirmant l'humanite de tous les etres humains, sans exception. Les pseudo-pacificistes de notre epoque devraient en prendre de la graine..."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,To all you people who spend your afternoons writing long reviews of various Jennifer Lopez romantic comedies: You goddamn peasants wouldn't good cinema if it shot you in the face.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"renior's son as director. awesome, scary monicale guy was tight."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Are you kidding me?! One of the best films ever made. Beautiful film, I could go on for minutes about how lovely this film is. Stroheim is fantastic!"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the best war films I have ever seen. Well worth a watch or two.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Not optimistic. The way I like my movies. lol.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,A classic...a pacifist tale about being a prisoner during WW1 and written just before WW2...still very modern
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Ultra classique, cette oeuvre pacifique a reconcilie le temps d'un film la gauche et la droite des annees 30, qui pourtant se detestaient plus que Sarkozy et Laguiller. C'est dire la qualite du film."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Aristocracy, jewes, common people and the meaningless of wars. Great drama."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Greatest war film of all time?Could be.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,So good that I blatantly copied part of it for one of my 290s.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,So good that I blatantly copied part of it for one of my 290s.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A truly moving French classic about WW1. Performances are great, and the work of Renoir deserves 5 stars."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"One of the best ever, and best by renoir - and also amongst the best war movies ever."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Perhaps the best look at the insanity of World War I and the breakdown of European societies, from which they've arguably never really recovered."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,it's the best pacifist movie ever.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"GIRL IN WHITE: We saw ""Grand Illusion"" here last night.ALVY AND ANNIE (In unison) Oh, yeah?MAN ON THE SOFA (Looking over his shoulder at the group) That's a great film if you're high."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Perhaps the best anti-war film ever made.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"You have to see it for yourself to really understand why ""La Grande Illusion"" is pretty perfect as far as I can tell--to the point of feeling like it was made by someone magical or with a supernatural perspective."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,both Woody & I like this one
1.0,la_grande_illusion,easily one of the top 3 movies ever made
1.0,la_grande_illusion,the best anti-war film ever made!
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"un film de guerre humaniste, mais oui c'est possible."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,svartvit klassiker som handlar om grundläggande värderingar.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Prefect thoughout. Touching, deep, and full of social commentary. Both the cinematography and acting are ahead of thier time. I'm amazed that both Jean Gabin Erich von Stroheim were not awarded oscar nominations for thier performances."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the best film ever
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Le meilleur Film Anti-Guerre realise un peu avant la Deuxieme Guerre et tellement encore d'actualite! Une Grande lecon!
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"This is one of the best Anti war films I have ever seen. It describes the tragedy of the first world war so well, showing the changes to society that occur at that time perfectly."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,I watched it on TV in Japan. It was truely a piece of humanistic work.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Probably my favorite movie of all time, shot by the famous painter's son, beautiful depiction of gentlemanly peace in wartime. We're all just humans after all."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,A profound statement for peace. Starts as a prisoners-of-war picture but soon moves beyond genre and achieves... humanity.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Perhaps the finest WWI film ever. An anti-war film made at the brink of WWII.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,jean gabin is a sexy man
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Every good radical, socialist, idealist, anarchist, anti-nationalist, pacifist, humanist, and on and on should see this movie."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"In a cast of brilliant actors, I must single out Erich von Stroheim as the MOST brilliant! And that final scene, on skis. does NOT let you go!"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,My kind of war film.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A beautiful film in so many ways. Taken at face value, the film is entertaining as is. Delve below into the messages and implications of the story, though, and you'll find a bittersweetly intricate tale of human interaction and conflict and the strife that it so often carries."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A classic movie that defies easy classification. I would not call it simply ""anti-war""; war is mostly distant. Perhaps it is mostly about people in a situation that forces them the make ultimate choices of displaying what they are, or what they would like themselves to be."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,La Grande illusionUn classique magnifique et toujours d'actualité! Le combat des classes sociales! Tourné avant la 2ième guerre!!! ( 10/10 )
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Perhaps not Renoir's most radical film, but in my opinion his most moving, about the dislocations created by war and the at times futile struggles of men to stay somehow connected--to friends, to social classes, to lost conventions."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Lieutenant Rosenthal: Frontiers are an invention of men. Nature doesn't give a hoot.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,How can you make a war movie that's this witty and humane without trivializing its subject? Amazing. And the camera work is unrivaled (except by Bunuel).
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Excellent composition on war, culture, and class."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the truly great films.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"One of the most important movies ever made, reminding us of where our loyalties ultimately lie."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Absolute classic - and Jean Gabin is gorgeous!
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the finest films ever made and banned by Goebbels. A quintessential study on struggles of war and class.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Very rich metaphors, fabulous acting, very touching end scene...Rich portrayal of the war times and the never ending differences between nations...Very glad to have seen it..."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Far too overshadowed by its near-contemporary Rules of the Game, I think it's a masterpiece. Gabin and von Stroheim are outstanding, and the relationship that develops between them really gives a glimpse of what could have been had not the catastrophe of the Great War intervened."

1.0,la_grande_illusion,"What a brilliant movie, brilliant sequencing of WW I and WW II, a good example of poetic realism and the ironies and bitterness of life."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the greatest prison escape movies of all time with so much energy and enthusiasm.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,An incredibly powerfal piece for it's time. It's scary to think this was almost lost forever when the Nazi's occupied Paris...
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"The absurdity of war, the death of class privilege and the brotherhood of man. All in one great film."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,A beautiful film that is so real and alive. It takes a long time and lot of viewings but the payoff on this film is incredible.

1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Renoir would be proud. the disection and evolution of class, a timeless story."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"This film says so much about the futility of war. It especially looks into the future,and it's message says a lot about what's going on now as it did in the 1930s."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Takes on the grand illusions which an organized society fabricates to make sense of the world, and which we ourselves use to put ourselves in our place. As good as Renoir gets. Which is pretty dang good."

1.0,la_grande_illusion,"For all those who consider The Shawshank Redemption to be the greatest prison escape movie ever made, perhaps they need to take a look at Renoir's outing and reconsider."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,There's Jean Renoir and then there's everyone else. It's kind of true after you see this film. What a solid picture! A miracle of a film until you realize the sublime heartand mind of the artist in charge!
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A great political film. It's not just anti-war, it's also anti-jingoism. It's incredibly level-headed for an film produced by a French director on the eve of WWII."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Probably my favorite film by Jean Renoir - and that's saying something! A sophisticated reflection on class and civility during the Great War. Featuring some of the finest acting the camera ever captured, Renoir's Grand Illusion stands deservedly as one of the cinema's all time greats."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Certainly my favourite film. I prefer it to Rules of the Game. A most beautiful and humane film.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,An unmatched look at the farce of war and a clear proof that you don't need any bulletholes to make a war classic.

1.0,la_grande_illusion,As close to perfection as any film ever made.

1.0,la_grande_illusion,A wonderful plea for peace made in the days before WWII.

1.0,la_grande_illusion,best war movie ever! if you want to see how war movies should be made it's like this. not to have war look cool.

1.0,400_blows,"The title of the film comes from the French idiom ""faire les quatre cents coups"", meaning ""to raise hell"". It is an unflinching look at a boy quick descent into misdemeanors and petty crime because of negligent and insensitive adults. Jean-Pierre LÃ©aud is a real tour de force."
1.0,400_blows,"Completely heart breaking. Something about this film really hits home. It captures a system blaming a child for a broken system, and parents blaming a child for bad parenting. It's clear that Antoine's problem's won't stop at the end of the movie. Very powerful."

0.0,400_blows,THE 400 BLOWS ... It certainly does.
1.0,400_blows,"Truffaut's debut film is a masterpiece of thoughtful visual storytelling, a beautiful synthesis of art and realism.

1.0,400_blows,"As a sucker for coming-of-age films, The 400 Blows delivers. Set in Paris, this film follows Antoine through his daily life and reveals the events that have led him to feel alone despite everyone around him. The sense of isolation builds until the end."

1.0,400_blows,Very classic French film. Message is deep.
1.0,400_blows,"Probably the best performance by a kid i've seen in a movie. Leaud is so good, he shows the character's confusion and angst so well. And Truffaut makes the character believable and easy to relate to. The last shot is something that will stay with you and haunt your dreams."
1.0,400_blows,"A truly revolutionary film in its day , this movie turned moviemaking on its head. The first of the Doinel cycle. Rich and textured, JP LÃ (C)aud gives a wonderful performance, really unbelievable for a teenage newcomer."

1.0,400_blows,"You would all be crazy missing out on this movie about a young boy's sadness and detachment which is caused by his parents in Paris. This turns him to a life of crime but we still surprisingly root for his cause of wanting to be free. It is almost like ""The Catcher in the Rye""."
1.0,400_blows,Great French classic.
1.0,400_blows,A simple but perfect movie.
1.0,400_blows,"Classic, one of the best movies of all time"

1.0,400_blows,"One of the most ""Ahead-of-It's-Time"" films I've ever seen. Astonishing to watch considering what was being played in America at the time and proof that the French basically invented modern filmmaking during their New Wave period."
1.0,400_blows,A masterpiece in storytelling
1.0,400_blows,"Absolutely love Truffaut. Just made the best coming of age story. Tortured at home, can't make it on the streets, screwed over by friends, not to mention going to a Boy's Only Reform Camp. Just what 1959 was all about. Loved every second."
1.0,400_blows,"Truffaut's classic black comedy is a masterpiece that compares to no others; Francois's camera work is subtle, but unrestrained."
1.0,400_blows,"Truffaut's timeless masterpiece still holds up today on emotional, philosophical, and technical levels. The cinematography is as stunning as ever, with several images that will linger in your mind for a long time, crafting an inspiring and moving coming of age tale."

1.0,400_blows,4/4--This film is so brilliant that I don't consider it a movie. Its a piece of the human soul that everyone can relate to.
1.0,400_blows,Truffaut is an all out genius. An incredibly heartfelt and relatable French New Wave masterpiece.
1.0,400_blows,"Part a homage to childhood (similar to Amarcord) and part a critique of French society, this masterpiece chronicles the gradual descent into delinquency of a normal, bright boy."

1.0,400_blows,This movie broke my heart!Funny that this one is so sad and intense and the others are comedies.
1.0,400_blows,"The first time I saw this it was in a double bill with Jules and Jim.I like Jules and Jim, but this film affected me on a personal level. I completely related to the character of Antoine Doinel. One of Truffaut's best."

1.0,400_blows,This is one of those movies that just makes you go wow. I was enthralled the whole time and was completely invested in all of the characters. I am very excited to see more of Francois Truffaut's films because quite frankly this movie was amazing.

1.0,400_blows,This movie is for pussies.
1.0,400_blows,I really love the few French New Wave films I've watched because they've got the quality of art from the 1920s-30's - it's fresh and iconoclastic -- driven by the pretension of youth. Les 400 Coups is to the New Wave as The Fountain is to Dada.
1.0,400_blows,"Awesome, awesome movie! Love it!"
1.0,400_blows,Wow this is such a great movie.  This is the best forgein film ever

1.0,400_blows,"The 400 blows reminded me once again what it's like to be 13.  Francois Truffaut's first feauture film is not only a staple of French new wave, but also one of the best films ever on adolesence. What beautiful black and white photography!  Masterpiece."

1.0,400_blows,classic piece of french cinema from francois truffaut.
1.0,400_blows,"I don't think Truffaut ever surpassed this one. He came close, but for me the lingering, nostalgic naturalism and sense of childhood's finite nature make this one impossible not to love on a very simple level."

1.0,400_blows,Fantastic...one of the best foreign films I've seen in a while.
1.0,400_blows,"Superb acting to complement a powerful story. The film makes a clear suggestion that messed up adults create messed up kids. On the flip side, kids can be quite resilient in trying to find ways to survive the mixed messages of the adult world around them."
1.0,400_blows,The only film from the French New Wave I can re-watch. This film affected me the way Catcher in the Rye did for many other folks.
1.0,400_blows,The film that woke me up to cinema when I was a teenage.Thanks PBS!
1.0,400_blows,This is a timeless classic - a beautiful beautiful story of a mischievous young boy deserted by the world (save perhaps his lone friend) who looks for an escape and finds none - the tracking shot followed by the sea and that freeze... unbelievable.

1.0,400_blows,"I'm going to avoid name dropping things like ""French new wave"" and such and describe the film as some said it to me.""It's like Degrassi Junior High if Degrassi Junior High was awesome and French and had better music.""I'm inclined to agree."

1.0,400_blows,"Truffaut's film, the 400 blows is as much autobiographical as it is poignant and true to life. Antoine is a character that awakens our understanding of what it was like to be 14 again."

1.0,400_blows,Incredible! Sooooo... ORIGINAL!!!
1.0,400_blows,A very intriguing movie. It has one of the best themes ever in the beginning of the film. I found this to be a clever insight on a kid who is trying to break free from restraint.
1.0,400_blows,Especially the scene with the typewriter...
1.0,400_blows,"Bob Hayes: What the hell was that ending? That's just Truffaut being Truffaut. Patrick Hayes: Okay. so, he gets to the ocean which he's never seen before and he sees it. And he's like, ""Shit, what do I do now?""Bob Hayes: ..."

1.0,room_2015,Great movie. Scary that things like this do happen.

1.0,room_2015,"This was a tough movie to watch in one sitting because of the strong emotions involved. Jacob Tremblay who played the child, has done an outstanding job at conveying the strangeness of suddenly experiencing freedom after being born into, and living a life of, captivity for 5 years."
1.0,room_2015,Brilliant. Think this is another case where the movie was better than the book (the horror!). Acting was incredible- cried multiple times.

1.0,room_2015,This movie deserves all the hype.
1.0,room_2015,"Despite the grim premise, Room is ultimately not a film about captivity or abuse - don't be put off by these elements. This is a really extraordinary story about the love between a mother and son and the capacity of a child's imagination. Moving and uplifting."
1.0,room_2015,"Wow! What a great movie, it's moving.That little boy in the movie is a rising star. Bre did a Fabulous job of conveying a mothers love.A must see movie! Probably the best of the year."

1.0,room_2015,awesome movie! eye opening on the everyday basics we take for granted
1.0,room_2015,Great movie! The little boy should have won an academy award as well!
1.0,room_2015,I really hate this movie. I hate it because it was so good yet almost unbearably devastating. Jacob Tremblay is frighteningly convincing.
1.0,room_2015,"Riveting, heartfelt, unique and compelling drama. The performances make this story feel as if it were true."
1.0,room_2015,"Brie Larson is astonishing and fully deserves that Oscar but Jacob Tremblay steals the film, and what an emotional, outstandingly acted and wonderfully structured film it is. Honest, inspiring and human."
0.0,room_2015,Not as good as THE Room (2003)
1.0,room_2015,Never underestimate the will of the human spirit. As well as a mothers love for her child.
1.0,room_2015,Great performances and a really good movie. One of the year's best.
1.0,room_2015,this is an translation like to kill a mockingbird and no country for old men and man its as good as those movies.
1.0,room_2015,"Loved it. Brie Larson is great in it, and the kid deserved the oscar almost as much as Leo ;)"
1.0,room_2015,I can't get this movie out of my head. The little boy sweet as pie and the mother fiercely loving him.
1.0,room_2015,One of the most gripping and intuitive movies I've seen. No other movie like it.

1.0,room_2015,"A movie that has an emotional tone, but worth watching. Brie Larson and Jacob Trembley shine in the film as well as the rest. Lenny Abrahamson does also do well in his directional debut"
1.0,room_2015,Amazing. I was fascinated by the young actor's perfect acting. So good photography!
0.0,room_2015,If I never ever have to see this movie again it will be WAY to soon. Ughhhhh -1

1.0,room_2015,Exceptional movie we watched this evening.
1.0,room_2015,"The two lead actors make this world feel so real, it's haunting."
1.0,room_2015,"This film never compromised with telling it's tale. It was a painful, untidy, sometimes contradictory picture. It sensitively depicted mother and child creating a world adapted to but never defeated by the big bad wolf who regularly visited to cause hurt. A hurt that would stay with them forever."
1.0,room_2015,Shocking but awesome movie. Wow!
1.0,room_2015,Great movie with authentic actress. After I watched this movie I reminded myself about quote from 127 Hours movie: There is no force more powerful than will to live.
1.0,room_2015,Going to lock myself in my room and read the book now. Goodbye world.
1.0,room_2015,"This movie doesn't have a single word to describe this movie, some people could say that was okay, great but for me it is an outstanding movie with a great cast and a great director. This movie gets into your heart."

1.0,room_2015,just got punched in the heart
1.0,room_2015,Wonderful and beautiful film that reminds me of how magical and joyful life can be--balanced by painful episodes which allows us to view life with perspective. See this film if you have not!
1.0,room_2015,Room is led by amazing performances from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay that gives us a mesmerizing look into the psychological and emotional stress from a traumatic event.
1.0,room_2015,This is one of the best dramas I've seen all year! I highly recommend it. It was very close to the book too. See it if possible!

1.0,room_2015,All I have to say is that this movie was better than spotlight myself and everyone who watched this movie were pretty sad when this movie didn't win best picture.
1.0,room_2015,"One of the best pictures of this Oscar ceremony. Brie Larson's work is amazing. So, she played one of the best women characters that I've ever seen."
1.0,room_2015,"Some kind of wonderful, touching story of the leftovers and traumas of a kidnapped and raped mother and her child."

1.0,room_2015,"It's not the idea behind the movie that makes it so great, but the amazing acting and storytelling."
1.0,room_2015,Heart wrenching and heart warming. Spectacular performances.
1.0,room_2015,Shame that Academy doesn't have kids category. Room is Jacob Tremblay's game and he played it well with his acting skills. Lenny Abrahamson mastered the indie-film craft.
1.0,room_2015,"What an amazing and uplifting film. truly shows the resilience of children and the bond between a mother and her child. Not just with her and her son, but her mother and her as well."

1.0,room_2015,One of the most beautiful films I've ever seen.
1.0,room_2015,Jacob Tremblay and Brie Larson are the perfect team when it comes to this film. The story line was great. The director was able to show this story that could have gone down a completely dark path but was able to show us some hope in every situation. Definitely one of my favorites.
1.0,room_2015,What a great and emotional movie. Brie Larson definitely deserved the Best Actress and Jacob Tremblay was deserving of at the very least supporting actor or some recognition. Get your tissues ready :'(
1.0,room_2015,"Amazing! Heartbreaking & heartwarming at the same time. If you haven't watched this yet, DO IT! You will not regret it"
1.0,room_2015,Great movie with incredible performances but it will likely haunt you...I saw it about a month ago and I still think of it whenever I see a little boy...the combination of child and sexual abuse (done in such a realistic way) may be too much for some to handle.
1.0,room_2015,Amazing movie with amazing actors.
1.0,room_2015,"Fantastic movie. Stuningly acted by both Brie Larsen and Jacob Tremblay. You'll think often about the impact tis film has on you for several days. Frightening and tender, these two actors make for an unforgettable viewing experience."

Made me cry for the first time ever. Brilliant film great job. Should've won best picture. Far superior film than spotlight.
1.0,room_2015,The most beautiful films I've seen in a very long time. Jacob Tremblay is so innocent and pure in this film. Some of the greatest acting I've ever seen from a child. Go see this movie immediately.
1.0,room_2015,"Harsh, intense, and moving. This film's ultimate look into the minds of those keep in isolation against their will for years and the effects it has on them once they manage to escape."
1.0,room_2015,"Nada de super produção, esse é o tipo de filme que somente com suas palavras te faz parar para refletir, e por fim chorar."

1.0,room_2015,This was compelling from the start. Amazingly acted with both main actors deserving an oscar..Very emotional indeed. Best film I've seen for a long time. Most are too long - I didn't want this one to end.

1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,"A classic. Perceptive and knowing in its handling of the female characters and the world they inhabit. And note Marilyn Monroe in an early role, already averting the camera's gaze away from the others. Bette Davis gives one of the iconic Hollywood performances."

1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,"This brilliant movie is a study of characters with reel- and real-life Bette Davis at the heart of it, almost auto-biographical, and certainly a comic dramatic, film-noir."
1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,"Mankiewicz wrote one of the great screenplays here, filled with acid wit and unforgettable quips . . . oh, and the cast is perfect."

1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,"A fantastic story of envy, narcissism, and the rise to fame, all set in the ""innocent"" theater industry. The script is impeccable and cleverly written, and the performances give justice to it. This is a must see for every film lover. This is one of the real classics, not fucking Wizard of Oz."

1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,The psychology of the theatre actress has never had a better rendering on the silver screen.

1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,"It's a really talky film, and there's not that much plot to speak of, but that just helps to better serve one of the greatest scripts ever written. Every line crackles with acidic wit, and the actors all deliver their lines with relish. Bette Davis, in particular, gives a performance for the ages."

1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,Lightly soapy dramedy gets obliterated by the quintessential Bette Davis no-nonsense role that cemented her superstardom. Stunning & Hilarious - sit back and watch.. It's going to be a bumpy ride.. Hahahahaha
1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,"A young fan finally meets her broadway idol & quickly sweeps into her life & straightens up the messes, but maybe she's not as perfect as she appears. A fantastic film about our star-obsessed culture & the cutthroat ways to get ahead."

1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,Close to perfect. Davis is at her vitriolic best and Baxter is vindictive and scheming. Also the small parts played by Ritter and Monroe were wonderful. The change from adorable to despicable of Eve is handled so well that you hang on every scene. Perhaps the best script ever written.

1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,"Great performances. And remains certain questions for the identity of the human being: who is Eve? Who is Margot? Who are actually the people, by which they are imitated?"
1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,"Bette Davis is maybe the best reason for anyone to watch it, as well as the the excellent work by Manciewicz (co-writter of the script for Welles's ""Citizen Kane"")."
1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,was 1950 the year of satirizing film and theater? superb direction and great performances and the story sucks you in.

1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,"Burning with cynicism, rage and multiple layers. Massive standout performance from Bette. Revolutionary use of multiple perspectives to construct a tale. A great accompaniment to Sleuth, although much better actedPossibly the best film about acting ever realised"
1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,Loved loved LOVED this movie. A lot. Everything from the story to the acting was fantastic. It's a hard core look at what stardom and the drive to be famous can do to a person.
1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,The bitchiest film ever made. An outstanding script with dynamite performances. It's a brutal attack on Hollywood and the fanaticism with celebrities. Timeless and way ahead of its time. It makes a nice companion piece to both A Star is Born (with Garland) and Scorsese's King of Comedy.

1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,"Finally, a film with a female heroine and a female villain, and it's not a chick flick! Witty and smart dialogue with such devilish plot twists. I don't know anyone who can resist the charm of Bette Davis. ""Fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy night!"""

1.0,let_the_right_one_in,"The English dub is awful. Completely disregard it. The actual film in its native tongue is a bitter sweet chocolate that you will still taste long after the credits finish. The camera work is some of my favorite of any movie. It's dark, lonely, compelling, and wonderful."
1.0,let_the_right_one_in,"""Let The Right One In"" is like a fairytale in vampire/horror style, it has brilliant story, a love story but never be lack of haunting event. This is the one of the best vampire film and one of highest quality romance film I've ever seen, and it made ""Twilight"" seems like a piece of trash."

1.0,let_the_right_one_in,"Let the Right One In comes at a perfect time to reinvent vampires, making them more human and relatable rather than killers. Due to the high quality of the actors, the story, and the overall feel, this movie feels more like a movie about kids that features vampires in it."

1.0,argo_2012,Simply elegant - well done Geo political drama. Can not see any movie in resent pass could be in juxtapositioned.No wonder why Iran was so furious and denying as the whole world knew the truth not because President Clinton de clarified the rescue operation.

1.0,argo_2012,"Absolutely terrific! I remember when these events took place those many years ago. So I found it even more interesting to find out details of the release of those held captive and about Canada's involvement in their rescue! Edge of your seat exciting! Scrip, acting and directing are all excellent!"
0.0,argo_2012,Although technically well executed it was just another example of Hollywood propaganda changing the story to make Americans look great and Canadians appear as though they'd contributed nothing or not been brave and not risked their lives.

1.0,argo_2012,Great movie got to see it
1.0,argo_2012,One of the best movies I've seen. And a true story.
1.0,argo_2012,"Affleck proves (again) how much of a credible director he is...and for those who say isn't the best of actors, perhaps that's down to quality of previous scripts he has worked with. This proves that he is one of the finest actor/director's working in Hollywood today."
1.0,argo_2012,"Great story that needed to be told well, thanks!"
1.0,argo_2012,"Initially I wasn't interested in seeing this, however it's really worth the watch."
1.0,argo_2012,A real good historical piece that gives you a brief look into the Iranian revolution and what it was like for the American Hostages. Also gives a good but brief glimpse of how it affected people at home. So far it seems Ben Affleck as a director can't make an awful movie.
1.0,argo_2012,"This was a truly fantastic, intelligent, and gripping film. From start to finish, it had me completely captivated."
1.0,argo_2012,"slow burning, edge of your seat thriller that keeps you in full suspense right up to the credits. I love this film, ace story and quality perfomances, afflek proves himself a worthy director and also manages a decent if understated performance himself."

1.0,argo_2012,Impeccable and compelling. As perfect as a period piece can get and more suspenseful than anything you have ever seen.
1.0,argo_2012,Amazing! Great job future Batman!
1.0,argo_2012,Argo is such a special movie and based on an amazing story. While there are some added fictional elements for excitement. Argo recreates many true scenes as they took place during Iranian Hostage Crisis. You'll be on the edge of your seat.
1.0,argo_2012,"Argo is the embodiment of genuine, edge-of-your-seat cinema, even more so against its true story backdrop. Affleck is impeccable in both the leading role and as the films's director."

1.0,argo_2012,One of the best true-story nail-biters ever put to screen.
1.0,argo_2012,"Very engrossing story. Even if you come into it having read the back story (as I had) it's still a very engaging story with great performances by the cast and crew alike. Hopefully, this is Ben Affleck's Oscar picture. He deserves it...for his directing, at least."
1.0,argo_2012,"The ending was inevitable, but the suspense was so great I was sitting on the edge of my seat for 30 straight minutes. Kind of hurt my butt honestly."
1.0,argo_2012,"I found nothing wrong with this nail-biting, tense, edge-of-your-seat popcorn fick; a very deserving oscar winner for Best Picture and for my favourite film list of all time!"
1.0,argo_2012,"Terse and tightly constructed in a way that is somewhat rare from Hollywood. It's not quite a masterpiece, but it's not the ethnocentric piece of patriotism that some critics have said it is. Affleck is a masterful director (his acting here ain't even that bad) and he shows it. Amazing movie."
1.0,argo_2012,"Wow. What a movie, couldn't take my eyes off it, not one I'd watch again but brilliant"

1.0,argo_2012,"Odli?en muvi. Sem ostal kar presene?en. Zelo pristen 80s feel in na splono mi je zgodba zelo lepo izpeljana, nevsiljivo in nepretenciozno, okusno. Reija primerna zgodbi, igralska zasedba itak izjemna, tako da zelo priporo?am."
1.0,argo_2012,"Don't expect any high action battle scenes but this movie will still keep you tense to know how the outcome of all the hard work will turn out. I don't want to give out too much of the movie but as it states, this is all based on true events. You'll see what I mean."

1.0,argo_2012,"Although I give this film a 5 star rating I don't feel like it deserved the best picture. I felt out of the nominees I saw I would pick Django Unchained. However this movie was a great thriller drama, despite some false info for a ""true"" movie."
1.0,argo_2012,"Ben Affleck directs and stars in this slickly made suspense/docudrama. The intensity is balanced out by humor (at the expense of late 70s Hollywood), creating a near perfect film. With this and his previous directing/starring effort (The Town), Affleck has really come into his own."

1.0,moonlight_2016,It's not an enjoyable movie. Not because it's bad. Because it's so real and too deep. A flawless movie that definitely isn't for everyone.

1.0,moonlight_2016,It really brought me back to when I was young growing up in the inner city.

Watch out the scene where the new wife is persuaded to commit suicide by Mrs. Denvers. Hitchcock @ his best!"
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Beautifully sinister and understated Hitchcock masterpiece about grief and obsession.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Simply awesome. Laurence Olivier is really everything is cracked up to be and so is Hitchcock. I have not seen Joan Fontaine in many films but she was great in this.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,One of my top 3 movies ever...........and my favorite Hitchcock movie. Joan Fontaine is perfect in this movie.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"It's not one of my favorite Hitchcock films (I prefer the psychological complexity of Vertigo or Shadow of a Doubt), but Rebecca is without a doubt one of his most solid, well-concieved, and flat-out best."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"After Rear Window, this is my favorite Hitchcock movie!! Hitchcock has done an amazing job directing the adaptation of this timeless novel..."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"I think this is the best movie Hitchcock made and he made some good ones. it's also an excelent adaptation of the novel, even though some important things are changed it is forgivable if the result is this masterpiece"
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Really, really good."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,one of the all-time best Hitchcock thrillers!
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"So much fun, but still sophisticated. You wouldn't know Hitchcock directed it without seeing the credits, for it lacks his usual tight structure and other trademarks. However, the eerieness never lets up. Mrs. Danvers is the creepiest craziest person ever- and I love her for it!"
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Fantastic Hitchcock film. Loved it!
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"hitchcock's first american film! it's just beautifully made and a really fun story. george sanders is his usual sleazy ambiguously gay self, and olivier is just a fucking fox."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"buenisima!!, buena trama, buenas locaciones !"
1.0,1017293-rebecca,A must see. One of Hitchcock's best but one of his most under-heard.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,This is my all-time favorite movie.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Yes, Larry Olivier did Hitchcock! Most bizarre!"
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"So after seeing this, I think that Vertigo, North by Northwest, and now Rebecca are my favorite Hitchcock films."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Hitchcocks bÃ¤sta film!
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"AMAZING movie. As if Laurence Oliver's being in it doesn't already make it a 5-star movie, it has a GREAT storyline. Rebecca-- SEE IT."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"This movie is why Alfred Hitchcock is my favorite director, Hitchcocks finest film. Wonderful musical score, mysterious and haunting. I just love films and B&W; and Alfred Hitchcock was a genius at directing which makes it a treat when watching his films."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"An early masterpiece from Hitchcock. I'm ashamed that I hadn't seen it until now, it won best picture for a reason. It seems to not have aged, and the acting and cinematography is spectacular. Very highly recommended!"
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"I prefer a lot of the older Hitchcock works--I think they're overlooked because they're not in color, but Rebecca has all the drama and suspense of Vertigo. Plus, it opens with a model shot, and I always love those."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Incredible book - incredible movie.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,this movie literally hypnotized me... it was creepy and beautiful and there was not a moment i guessed right
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Again, brilliant. This may be my favorite Hitchcock film actually."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,one of the best films of the master
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Great movie! Mrs. Danvers is terrifying, and the story is wonderful!"
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Another great Hitchcock film. Suspenseful. Based on book by Daphne DuMaurier.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Fell in love with Joan Fontaine for a while after seeing this for the first time. It was the start of my fascination with golden age cinema and with Hitchcock. I love this film, and it has the best name of all time - George Fortesque Maximilian De Winter."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,The storyline is very tense and I think the mannerisms of each character are very accurate in terms of establishing the very distinctive role they have in the film.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,I love Hitchcock and this is my favorite movie of all time.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,my favorite Hitchcock film.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"This somehow gets forgotten amidst the flashy 50's and 60's Hitchcocks, but. This is really one of his spooky best... With one of the most chilling bad-guys (Mrs. Danvers) in movies."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Loved it. Again, the lovely Jon Fontaine!"
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Based on the novel by Daphne Du Maurier, this ""modern Gothic"" is the only Hitchcock film to win Best Picture. Laurence Olivier is perfect and never handsomer as Maxim de Winter, and Joan Fontaine steals your heart as his mousy new wife, but Judith Anderson is haunting as Mrs. Danvers."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"this is in the top 10 fave. movies for me. so suspenseful, fantastic ending !!"
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Excellent film with a dead woman running the show seemingly. Joan Fontaine as the no name bride of Maxwell DeWinter (Laurence Olivier) who's dead wife haunts him. But Why????

1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Without a doubt Hitchcock's most unique film. Creepy, beautiful, and wonderfully mysterious; not only absorbs you in a character who never once appears on screen, but in the others who do as well. Magnificent."

1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Wonderful Hitchcock and so subtly creepy. One of my favorites, not only because of the terrific script and acting by the leads, but of Mrs. Danvers. What a haunting impression this woman leaves on you."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"A perfect adaptation of Daphne Du Maurier's gothic classic! Olivier and Fontaine made for a superb cast, and the entire movie from start to finish was every bit as tense, thrilling and gripping as the book. You cant go wrong with Hitchcock I guess."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Classicly creepy. Its probably my favorite Hitchcock
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Atmospheric & dark. The protrayal of Mrs Danvers is truly chilling. Joan Fontaine was perfectly cast in this movie.

1.0,nightcrawler,One of the best movies of the decade... easily. So much thrill the first time I watched this movie. So much suspense and emotion. I can't find any faults with this film. It's seems to be perfect and is easily one of my favorite Drama/Thriller movies.
1.0,nightcrawler,"A movie that transcends the cinema as it really shows how the world of news is really ran. Gyllenhaal's performance is so amazing, his level of sleaziness made me want to take a shower after watching. RIP Bill Paxton."
1.0,nightcrawler,"A chilling performance by Jake Gyllenhaal creates an original film unlike any before. Filled with great dialogue and beautiful visuals, ""Nightcrawler"", exposes the depths to which some people go to attain fame and does it convincingly."
0.0,nightcrawler,Couldn't even get through it; very slow
0.0,nightcrawler,Jake Gyllenhaal character has an annoying factor that makes it hard to watch. I was disappointed.
1.0,nightcrawler,"One of the best independent movies ever made. 2014s ""Taxi Driver"""
1.0,nightcrawler,"It's so intense and brutal, amazing performance from Jake, he looked the part too which was terrifyingly impressive. Overall it's quite a scary film where obsession of what you love could drive you crazy and be the death of you."
1.0,nightcrawler,"It is haunting in every way, and gives you a Network vibe until the last scene of the movie. Journalists going way out of bounds of morality and ethics for the sake of acquiring good TV ratings. Nice thrilling movie.Jake Gyllenhall gives one of the most enthralling performances of the year."
1.0,nightcrawler,"Brilliantly acted, amazingly written, and an original plot. What more can you ask for?"

1.0,nightcrawler,"Jake Gyllenhaal gives a strong performance as the creepy, psychopathic monster, Lou Bloom. Bloom takes a liking to freelance crime journalism and becomes very disturbing and menacing in the process. Definitely on of Jake Gyllenhaal's best performances. Rene Russo was also strong in her performance."
1.0,nightcrawler,"Well done. To me this a character study of the textbook psychopath. He is ambitious, callous, glib, intelligent and deeply self centered. They walk among us, Very complex layers of insanity. I really enjoyed watching this."

1.0,nightcrawler,Instant classic. Stone cold masterpiece

1.0,nightcrawler,"He[Gyllenhaal]dissapears into this character and you do not see the actor,you see the character.The film itself was ok and could've been better but the twisted,eccentric and thrilling performance Mr.Gyllenhaal gives us is compelling.Note to the Academy:Give Jake Gyllenhaal the Oscar nod."
1.0,nightcrawler,"'Nightcrawler' is a taut, knuckle-whitening thriller that takes audiences on one hell of a ride. Jake Gyllenhaal gives the best performance of his career (and one of the best of any movie that year), and seems to be having a blast messing with people's heads."

1.0,nightcrawler,"Took a bit to get started, but man does this movie make you feel insane. Gyllenhaal gives a truly Oscar worthy performance as he just loses his mind in this movie.

1.0,nightcrawler,"Horribly dark and disgusting, but Gyllenhaal plays the slime ball so well you can almost forget to hate him, at least up until the end."
1.0,nightcrawler,"A perfect movie. Smart, Unpredictable and utterly creepy."
0.0,nightcrawler,One of the most uninspiring films I have ever seen. My biggest regret is that I wasted my time all the way to the end.

1.0,nightcrawler,One of the best films in 2014. :)
1.0,nightcrawler,I loved it. Jake Gyllenhaal performance gave me the chills. It's interesting and very realistic. It shows how fucked up is the world nowadays and if you want to grow in the news business you better be ready to get dirty.
1.0,nightcrawler,"Jake Gyllenhaal gives one, if not, the best performance of 2014, maybe only being beaten by J.K Simmons for Whiplash. A fascinating look into the mind of a sociopath."

1.0,nightcrawler,"Dare I say, a Joker-like mindset in Gyllenhaal's character makes this movie that much more thrilling."
1.0,nightcrawler,Night Crawler is special in not having a protagonist but still tightly gripping the audience throughout the film. Jake Gyllenhaal is AMAZING and the writing is superb. Worthy of multiple viewings.
1.0,nightcrawler,"Jake Gyllenhaal captures his character perfectly. An emotionless, ambitious, singularly focused character who is willing to do whatever it takes for the dollar. I found myself at the edge of my seat multiple times."

1.0,nightcrawler,"""I feel like grabbing you by your ears right now and screaming, 'I'm not fucking interested!'. Instead, I'm going to drive home and do some accounting.""This movie is just pretty damn near perfect.

1.0,nightcrawler,Performance of the year by Gyllenhaal. Showing that he's the best actor of our generation (watch out Leo).
1.0,nightcrawler,"Fantastic movies! I love movies centered around sociopaths. The reason is because they are so interesting to watch. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat. Yes, the ending was a bit strange, but overall a fantastic movie."

1.0,1013775-metropolis,Even though it is not my number 1 sci-fi film (only because it is hard for me to watch silent films) I can agree that Metropolis is the greatest sci-fi film of all time.

0.0,1013775-metropolis,i felt like the most interesting thing in the movie was the music. All throughout the movie there is different types of music like fast or mysterious to show something bad is happening or about to happen. The music definetely made the movie a lot more intense.

1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Excellent. Very realistic move about anti-colonial insurrection and urban warfare. French colonial rule in Algeria and its parallels with Iraq are unmistakable.

1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,extraordinary film which has the feel of a documentary. Haven't seen it for some time but is one I wish I had on dvd
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,"What a movie, in some ways filmed like a documentary. its raw and violent, quite uncompromising. Shows the utter brutalities commited on each side, FLN are portrayed as well organised urban guerillas, who carry on the fight even when all looks hopeless. Dont miss the Ennio Morricone score either"
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,why oh why have I waited this long to see it?? Amongst the rarest of truly greats to grace our screens. It'll visually blow your mind to bits. A hard lesson for all the warmongers and bullies that they'll get theirs sooner or later.

1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,"Once upon a time France was the oppressive colonialist power in the world. This film pulls no punches when it shows the methods both sides used during the conflict, illustrates the drama on both sides well, and remains remarkably applicable in current world affairs."

1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,"Quite simply the most exceptional and true to life screen depiction of revolution (I think, although the only revolution I've actually seen is from the MLS). Also, it shows up the French and surely that's a good thing (I think?)"
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Filled with more political symbolism than you can shake a baton at.
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,"Real and powerful. A must see. Morricone's music adds to the impact. Impossible to remain unimpressed by Algeria's courageous women. In all, a political journey that gratifies with rare glimpses of the deep alleyways hidden in Algiers' Casbah."

1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Best movie of all time.
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,This movie was meant to be a manifesto against colonialism enforced by military power. Nowadays the French general looks more like the prototype of the perfect American soldier determined to fight against terrorism. The 9/11 campaign has changed our view about many things.
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Marvelous and very ahead of its time.
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Pontecorvo's stunningly realised rendition of the struggle against colonialism remains must see viewing for any would be imperialist.

1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Amazing B&W; movie shot shortly after the Algerian independence with some of the actual people involved in the uprising. This movie is a historical gem because it shows both sides and does so with many of the people that participated in this part of history.

1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,"Cold-blooded assasinations, street shoutouts, cafe bombings, riots and torture are the tools used by the Algierian insurgents and occupying French. The warts of both warring factions are shown on both sides in this depressingly familiar, yet utterly fascinating, documentary-style war picture."
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Very much a film a film for now. Wonderful chronicle of events. A great unbiased view on terrorism and the people doing it.

1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,"This is like ""The Wire"" on HBO, but about an insurgency instead of the drug trade. Dispassionate and unsparing about the motivations and failings of both sides."
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,allright you lefty revolutionaries. Here's the real deal.
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Should be required viewing for all wannabe imperialists.
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,"The cinematograpy, the acting, the story all place this movie as one of the best ever made. Its funny how the ""terrorists"" were able to portray the French in an evenhanded way, something Hollywood has been unable to do when they are depicting 'terrorists' in lesser films."

1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,"A supreme film about the battle of Algiers, watch the version with a native (as I did, with two of my Algerian mates) as some of the subtitles are wrong (purposely) or missing. Was banned in France for over 20 years or something. Oh yeah and the brilliant music is partly by Ennio Morricone."
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Pontecorvo's stunningly realised rendition of the struggle against colonialism remains must see viewing for any would be imperialist.
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Staggering. A real highpoint of the development of cinema. The whole bombing sequence in the middle of the picture is rivetting. Morricone and Pontecorvo's musical choices remain striking to this day.

1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,"This film has become more significant each year since its release in 1967. It is a very realistic portrayal of the Algerian anti-colonial terrorism campaign which demonizes neither the French nor the Algerians, but points out their strengths and weaknesses."
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,"A Post-colonial, cinéma vérité masterpiece. Pontecorvo casted non-professional Algerian Arabs and Gatti shot the film in such a way to make it look like a newsreel or documentary film."
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,The fact that this has been screened to US government officials to analyze terrorist behavior should speak volumes.

1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,"The ultimate political movie. Pontecorvo shows great skill as a director with his cast of non-actors. Pontecorvo and Solinas crafted a script so powerful, so politically relevant today."
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Further evidence that you can't fight terrorism with more terrorism. The fact this film was screened for CIA operatives PRIOR to the invasion (and subsequent occupation) of Iraq simply proves that we've learned almost nothing from history.
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Everyone should see this movie. It is just as relavent today as it was fourty years ago.
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Awesome flick. FYI: officers in the US army were told to see this movie before the invasion of iraq to learn counter-insurgency tactics. Funny since the French lost.

1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,"This movie is a Molotov cocktail thrown from the battlements. At worst it'll inspire you to turn up your Rage Against the Machine and rail against ""the Man""; at best, it will forever change the way you think about violence, oppression, and resistance."

1.0,discreet_charm_of_the_bourgeoisie,The satire here is so very sharp. Bunuel has fangs and he's not afraid to bare them. In addition he plays with the form so masterfully; there are dreams within dreams. One is never quite sure where one is. No one gets off without a skewering.

1.0,discreet_charm_of_the_bourgeoisie,"It lacks the political and psychological depth of some of Bunuel's other films. Still, itâ??s loopy narrative structure of digressions, interruptions, dreams within dreams, and pointless story-lines makes it worth watching."

1.0,discreet_charm_of_the_bourgeoisie,My favorite from Buñuel. The plot sounds incredibly simple. Believe me it's not. Also includes some of the most terrifying nightmare sequences I've ever seen.

1.0,repulsion,when a filmmaker has a voice that is undeniable..
1.0,repulsion,"Holy what the hell AMAZING! I had never seen this, just watched first time, blown away. Catherine Deneuve is outstanding. Edgy, scary, descent into madness doesn't quite do it."
1.0,repulsion,"Polanski is masterful behind the camera, especially in his use of space. It's very gutsy and how disturbing it is is evidence of just that."
1.0,repulsion,"The perfect psychological reading that is generated in 'Repulsion' captures in very minute details the terrifying process towards total madness. If the fall to psychosis was a window into damnation, Polanski captures the very near hell of visual and sonorous master-class mosaics. 99/100"
1.0,repulsion,"While not only is this film so disturbing that you will feel as if you should take a shower after you finish it, it is also unbelievably heartbreaking in a realistic perspective. Which is why I think Repulsion is one of the best horror films of all time, even if it is a different kind of horror."
1.0,repulsion,"If you don't have claustrophobia organically, you'll likely have developed it in some form after watching this one. Another hit by Polanski. Once again Art House though... Part of The Criterion Collection and on Blu-ray in the US."

1.0,repulsion,"This is maybe the only movie that scared me. And it's weird, because it doesn't have gory imagery or something like that. This movie really plays with your mind. Everything works perfect. Watch it alone at night and have some nightmares."

1.0,repulsion,A disturbing film that hollows through a world of hallucination with unsettling horror.
1.0,repulsion,"My favourite Polanski film, this nightmarish trip into isolation and madness builds up tension and atmosphere, taking its audience hostage amid the claustrophobia and terror. The final shot (the photograph of Carol) is still one of the most powerful images in film history."

1.0,repulsion,"One of the best, smartest, and most unique horror films ever. This is a must see."
1.0,repulsion,One of the best psychological horror films that I have ever seen. Polanski is a master of building suspense in the confines of small spaces.
1.0,repulsion,This was really something. The score. The acting. The terror. Polanski has dark sorceress powers. Completely redefines the horror movie. It's pure greatness.
1.0,repulsion,"If you have seen Black Swan and liked it, you will love this. It is even better, the original film about a schizophrenic's slow decent into madness. Absolutely astounding performance from Catherine Deneuve."
1.0,repulsion,Classic.  Catherine Deneuve is a complete stunner. Great score that fits the film perfectly by Chico Hamilton.
1.0,repulsion,Had me wincing in sheer anticipation of horror and jump out of my seat. And this was made before CGI and makeup. Roman Polanski's creepily atmospheric psychological drama about the slow descent of a girl into madness should be revered by the horror fans.
1.0,repulsion,Roman polanskis first english film follows a schizopherenic womans descent into madness and makes the audience feel as clausthrophic as the character
1.0,repulsion,We start off as innocent as the girl can be but slowly and murkily do we descend to a great pit of turmoil and disturbance. Excellent work from Polanski.
1.0,repulsion,Repulsion compels the viewer to be as claustrophobic as the paranoid lead woman as she journeys into insanity.
1.0,repulsion,Fianlly just saw this film and i'm not disappointed to movie is a masterpicie . This shows off the fPolanksis full potienal in theis surealist look in the a insaine mind. it obisouly shows its influence on directors like Lynch and Argento
1.0,repulsion,Deneuve showed that she could understand a director unlike any other actress who ever lived. Polanski's visuals and her acting make this one of the finest depictions of the descent into madness ever.
1.0,repulsion,Hands down the best Roman Polanski film in my humble opinion. And he's got a lot of good ones.
1.0,repulsion,"At first, the film exchanges excitement for eerieness, but then proceeds to capture the imagination of the viewer and keep them enthralled as Carol descends into insanity."

1.0,repulsion,"Early Polanski. If you have seen Knife in the Water and not this, imagine a movie that has just as many emotions as knife in the water, but represented through visuals of even more horror and beauty, you get this. Polanski's first horror film and arguably his best (maybe tied with Rosemary's Baby)."
1.0,repulsion,Polanski is great and knows how to make characters!
1.0,repulsion,"Repulsion, is an emotion you certainly won't feel while watching this intense, expertly crafted masterpiece."
1.0,repulsion,"An unsettling and unfortunate story which attempts to expound a virgin's fearfull perspective on sexual relations. This, combined with elements of real physical peril and mental illness, makes for a fascinated film. Typical slow Polanski build-up and revolutionary camera work."
1.0,repulsion,"Catherine Deneuve is perfect as the disturbed, sexually repressed young french girl in Roman Polankski's masterpiece about paranoia and sexuality. Amazing."
1.0,repulsion,"Absolutely terrifying, and beautifully filmed."

1.0,repulsion,May very well be Polanski's best film
0.0,repulsion,"Very disappointing. Pretentious piece of ""art""."
1.0,repulsion,This was made in 1965 and is still pretty impressive. The directing style is fantastic! Catherine Denevue's schizophrenia mixed in with her deep sexual impulses makes this film original and a gem.
1.0,repulsion,Very strange film about claustrophobia by roman polanski not really scary but it is a overall well done masterpiece for its time beautifully well done very thrilling movie and great screenplay co written by Polanski himself highly recommended

0.0,repulsion,polanski is a child rapist
0.0,repulsion,"Perhaps this was ""substantial"" when it came out, and is a classic that people reference, but nowadays it's simply terrible. Prepare to be bored out of your mind by a character you have no reason to care about, and distracted from the suspense by over the top techniques."
1.0,repulsion,Catherine Deneuve plays Carol too well.!!. =D Polanski's camera work and the effective use of black and white throughout the film greatly enhances the mood.The ending.........

1.0,repulsion,this movie is cold! polanksi is greatness
1.0,repulsion,This is one of the creepiest movies I have ever seen. I was as paranoid about the protagonist as I was her antagonist - loneliness. This is the kind of movie that makes you want to lock your doors and put yourself in a straitjacket.
1.0,repulsion,"Outstanding Deneuve in taut,nerve-cracking,misogyne thriller.Shall not miss it."
1.0,repulsion,"An enthralling, if not enchanting, work of art in a habitual genre to its audience at the time, but supposing that not half of the world have known yet the young talented Polanski, this film would have been his first masterpiece to reach them in a remark it would be remembered as a historical piece."
1.0,repulsion,An unquestionably perfect film.
1.0,repulsion,"The character development, the repetitions, the maddening background noises, the surreal imagery, the flawless camera direction, the empathy, the symbolism, the widening cracks..."
1.0,repulsion,This is the film Black Swan wanted to be. A flawless early effort from Roman Polanski.
1.0,repulsion,"The movie was made in 1965, though it's incorrectly dated on here as 1997. That annoyance aside, the film was genuinely terrifying and really stays with you, whether you want it too or not. Right up there with Jacob's Ladder for my all time favorite horror films."
1.0,repulsion,A disturbing film and with a great performance from Deneuve.
1.0,repulsion,"5 out of 5 - thanks to Flixter for doing everything wrong, again."
1.0,repulsion,I thought I was hearing things after watching this one.
1.0,repulsion,"Earliest proper psychological horror I've seen within the contemporary context. Highly original. However, don't bother with it if you don't like slightly low paced, black and white films."
1.0,repulsion,"One of the first Roman Polanski movies, it's a chilling masterpiece about woman's decent into madness."
1.0,repulsion,hey .... why in title is year 1997? .... It's a movie from 1965 ...
1.0,repulsion,"I don't throw around 5/5 easily, but Polanski's first English film (1965 London) is spot-on perfection. 100% on Rottentomatoes."
1.0,repulsion,"Polanski's first film of his urban terrors trilogy is efective simply because you can't never guess what is coming up next; I'm not easily impressed, but this one made me jump off my couch three times."
1.0,repulsion,"GREATTTT! film, starts out a little slow then really gets crazy. One of Polanski's ""Apartment Trilogy."" They are all good, but this one is quite insane."
1.0,repulsion,"Wierd, Yet Entertaining"
1.0,repulsion,"Haunting and claustrophobic, Repulsion places you in the room with it's disturbed protagonist, her degenerating psyche creating terrifying hallucinations, until she lashes out with violence to stop them. A classic Polanski nightmare."
1.0,repulsion,The absolute best movie I have ever seen about a woman descending into madness apart from Woman Under the Influence. I should just make a note that the criterion edition of this is MAGNIFICENT. SO CRISP & SHARP.
0.0,repulsion,"Awfully boring, then it gets annoying, and at the end a little bit interesting. Only for respect of the old perv Polanski watched till the end."
1.0,repulsion,A masterpiece from Polish master Roman Polanski. One of the most pygoloically distrubing films out there. This film is a looking into the isane and delsional mind of Carol Ledoux(played by Catherine Deneuve). Sureal and very atosphereic. This film shows that anyone can snap even you and even me.
1.0,repulsion,"Film Psychedelikohorrifique, un chef d'oeuvre noir et blanc d'une justesse et sobriété implacable et prenante."
1.0,repulsion,Repulsion is probably the best psychological thriller I've seen. A true masterpiece from a real genius Roman Polanski (Though I know he's charged with a rape case!). Don't forget lovely Catherine Deneuve:)
1.0,repulsion,"Not comfortable viewing, but for a reason. Polanski devastatingly interpets what too much isolation can do to the psyche... Draw your own conclusions."
1.0,repulsion,LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVED THIS MOVIE.
0.0,repulsion,I know I will be in the minority here but I was really dissapointed with Repulsion. Being a big Polanski fan I had been meaning to see this for some time and had high expectations. Some disturbing scenes which were good but the film just didn't seem to connect with me unlike his other works.
1.0,repulsion,Excellent... might type more laters.
1.0,repulsion,"An unsettling masterpiece, with a brilliant performance by Catherine Deneuve."
1.0,repulsion,"Absolutely horrifying. Catherine Deneuve is stunning, but I'll never be able to see her the same way again."
1.0,repulsion,"No one does a classier rape scene than Roman Polanski, The Devil and Rosemary is at the top of the list, but there were multiple ones in this so.........."
1.0,repulsion,Today's lesson: Don't leave the crazy lady alone with a straight razor.
1.0,repulsion,Disgusting. Shocking. Disturbing. Amazing.
1.0,repulsion,"The best movie Polanski has ever done, and along with The Hour of the Wolf the best paranoid movie ever."
1.0,repulsion,"This movie was a complete shock to me. I went in not expecting much, and came out hooked, compelled and excited. Barely anyone I know has seen this, but I recommend it. A slow burn that will build in tension, paranoia, and most importantly dread. Great oldie"
1.0,repulsion,"I'd have to say this is among one of my favourites now among the few really well done psychological-thrillers, such as Mulholland Dr. and Memento."
1.0,repulsion,Roman Polanski's first English language film (second overall) is perhaps the greatest psychological drama ever made. Check it out!
1.0,repulsion,Love those playful nuns out the window.

1.0,repulsion,"This movie is incredible. Beautifully shot, extremely shocking for it's time and in my opinion is the best cinematic portrayal of the progression of insanity that I have ever seen."
1.0,repulsion,"Alienation captured. We get to go into the depths of confusion. Polanski is able to strip away the veneer of civilization and manners. We see people in all of their rawness, and it isn't pretty."
1.0,repulsion,"Luultavasti jÃ?Â¤rkyttÃ?Â¤vin elokuva mitÃ?Â¤ koskaan olen nÃ?Â¤hnyt. Jumalainen Catherine Deneuve nÃ?Â¤yttelee hienosti tÃ?Â¤ssÃ?Â¤ leffassa. Edelleen pidÃ¤n tÃ¤tÃ¤ Polanskin pÃ¤Ã¤tyÃ¶nÃ¤, vaikka onhan Pianistikin hieno leffa."

1.0,repulsion,crazy film! definitely one of the most disturbing films i've seen. this has so much more depth than your average thriller. and Catherine Deneuve gives a very powerful performance.
1.0,repulsion,Polanski at his some of his most disturbing and innovative. Objects and lighting are key in progressing the unraveling of an already head-case. The dead rabbit is the thickest layer of visual metaphor. The violence has high anticipation but shocking in its honesty.
0.0,repulsion,color me unimpressed. there's a reason polanski ain't allowed in the u.s. he's a sick *#%$er.
1.0,repulsion,"The most unnerving film I've seen. The more closely I watch it, the more signs of the girl's increasing insanity I pick up on. The most disturbing thing of all is that anyone in passing may be about to snap. Anyone. If seen in a theater you may want to lock your car door for the drive home."

1.0,repulsion,Repulsion is the first of the tenant nightmares presented by Roman Polanksi. Brilliantly constructed. One of the best horror movies. Nobody understands horror movies like Polanksi.
1.0,repulsion,Fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Polanski si great!!
1.0,repulsion,Voyage au bout de la folie et du repliement sur soi. Ou comment devenir sa propre phobie. Tres certainement le plus grand film de Polanski.

1.0,repulsion,Classic suspense film is very atmospheric. Deneuve is fantastic and the film does not seem dated in the least.
1.0,repulsion,sultry psycho deneuve freaks out in swinging 60's Soho. silly rabbit!
1.0,repulsion,"I found this movie interesting. The way in which the camera moves to show the girls obsessions, fantasies and hallucinations is creative. Definatly different type of movie, for that era also. Very beyond its years."
1.0,repulsion,"Along with Eraserhead and Inland Empire, this is probably the best horror movie I've ever seen. If you are more terrified of mental illness than of men in hockey masks, this film is for you. Roman Polanski's debut feature and the introduction of Catherine Deneuve to the world. Remarkable."
1.0,repulsion,A great horror story!

1.0,repulsion,A woman's descent into madness. Watch for the parallel between her sanity and the rabbit.
1.0,repulsion,We discovered this Roman Polanski movie completely by chance and it was great. It is particularly interesting to see how it approached this theme years before it became a complete cliche.
1.0,repulsion,"Wonderful piece of horror about a lonely girl who badly needs to get laid. Love the rotting meat, the flies, the cracks in the walls. There's really nothing like it. Except maybe The Tenant"

1.0,repulsion,"Great movie, 10/10 on the disturbometer."

1.0,repulsion,"beautiful movie, an atmosphere that can hunt you in your dreams"
1.0,repulsion,"Truly amazing. And that's all due to the lead actress' very convincing and hauntingly realistic portrayal of a disturbed young woman, as well as Polanski's rather incredible direction . This film is pitch perfect as far as eerie or just outright frightening psychological thrillers go."
0.0,repulsion,"I barely made it passed the hour mark before I shut it off. Not because it's so ""terrifying"" and ""shocking"" as some people seem to think, but because it's horribly boring. Psychological thrillers were never really my genre anyways."

1.0,repulsion,"An intense portrayal of a woman losing her grip on reality. Fantastic direction, and Deneuve is enthralling."
1.0,repulsion,"Mitähän kaikkea voi liikkua yksinäisen, päästään lahon naisen mielessä? Polanski ohjaa ja Deneuve tekee toisen elämänsä suurista rooleista. Taustalla kuuskytluvun Lontoon svengaa erityisen nätisti."

1.0,repulsion,This is a very good movie that no one remembers any more. Just look at the camera. A psychological thriller were the camera is the main character. The soul of a sick girl is revealed through the lens.

1.0,anatomy-of-a-murder,"Jimmy Stewart at his country lawyer best. Tying flies as he defends a murderer. Interesting study of the legal system thirty five years before ""The People vs OJ Simpson""."
0.0,anatomy-of-a-murder,"Tedious and boring, might have been cutting edge in 1959. The only interesting thing about this movie was seeing how much more liberal we have become in society."

1.0,anatomy-of-a-murder,One of James Stewart's greatest performances.
1.0,anatomy-of-a-murder,A courtroom drama with the blunt verbal duel between lawyers Biegler and Dancer (James Srewart and George C. Scott). Lee Remick as Litenuant Manion's wife is sensuality itself.
1.0,anatomy-of-a-murder,"Preminger has fun examining the ambiguity of the courtroom milieu, and he's helped by great performances from Stewart and Scott. The Duke gives the film added kick w/ his sexy, seductive score."
1.0,anatomy-of-a-murder,"This is Otto Preminger at the top of his game, and also James Stewart at the same top as well. The film is interesting, thought provoking, and still relevant to this day."

1.0,anatomy-of-a-murder,"The intrigue of this movie comes from the fact that your mind will not agree with your emotions. As I was trying to determine the verdict for myself, my emotions were pulling me one way while my mind was pulling me the other. It was a great cinematic tug of war."
1.0,anatomy-of-a-murder,I think the best courtroom drama ever made. A slyly written and wonderfully acted movie. It's just another in a long line of great Jimmy Stewart films.

0.0,anatomy-of-a-murder,This is too childish to be enjoyed.
1.0,anatomy-of-a-murder,Could this be the perfect courtroom drama? Stewart is exceptional when he alternates between slyness and almost pointless outbursts. The ending is perhaps no big surprise but that is a minor inconveniance. No stellar marks on the gender-meter though.

1.0,anatomy-of-a-murder,This is a mature and brilliant courtroom drama with great performances and smart dialogue. It also pushes the boundries of what kind of dialogue and language was allowed in 50s films. James Stewart is excellent and the rest of the film is dramatic and suspenseful :fresh:
1.0,anatomy-of-a-murder,One of the best courtroom dramas ever.
1.0,anatomy-of-a-murder,"Another wonderful vehicle for perhaps the most loved actor ever to grace the silver screen.

1.0,anatomy-of-a-murder,"Wow. This is easily the best courtroom drama I've yet seen. Fantastic acting, an extremely complex story line, and blurred morality among every character makes the 160 minute running time never feel even the slightest bit boring. 5 stars."

1.0,night_of_the_hunter,100/A+. It's a Masterpiece of Cinema !
1.0,night_of_the_hunter,"I must have watched this movie at least a dozen times. It is wholly unique - its tone blackly comic, the storyline a hybrid of Grimm's fairytale and pursuit thriller. It is our loss that Laughton never directed another movie: with just this one work he proved he was one of the greats."

1.0,night_of_the_hunter,A chilling nightmare. Any film that has me literally clutching a pillow with white knuckles has accomplished something. Robert Mitchum is a terrifying villain who paints a religious allegory that may be more applicable to today's society than it was to that of the mid-50's.

1.0,night_of_the_hunter,"Fantastic and unforgettable movie. Mitchum is more than superb as a perfectly evil wolf in sheep's clothing.

1.0,night_of_the_hunter,Creepy--in a good way.
1.0,night_of_the_hunter,One cannot approach this film with the usual expectations. But no matter the opinion of a viewer upon the plot - it must admitted Robert Mitchum's portrayal of a fanatic preacher-psychokiller is excessive and frightening - and to a delightful degree.
1.0,night_of_the_hunter,"Gothic tale with the most memorable villain, the most memorable visual, the most engagin script. A truly American fairy-noir head of its time, without it perhaps neither Spielberg, nor Tim Burton, nor Cohen Brothers... nor a great part of modern cinema would have come to be. Pure L-O-V-E."

1.0,night_of_the_hunter,I had forgotten how crazy Mitchum's character is. He does these disturbing animal noises when he really doesn't get his way. No one in the current crop of serial killer movies has bested him.
1.0,night_of_the_hunter,Charles Laughton's only effort is a masterpiece.
1.0,night_of_the_hunter,Great example on how to start a movie with enough information and enough mystery to get the viewer hooked right away.

1.0,night_of_the_hunter,The speech where Robert Mitchum explains the LOVE and HATE tattoos on his knuckles is spell-binding. Very well made movie all around. Has a definite look to it as well as a definite southern flair. If you enjoy film noir you are likely to love this movie.

1.0,night_of_the_hunter,"A disturbing and strangely beautiful mix of ""Hansel & Gretel"" and ""Bluebeard"", this is more like a European expressionist film than a Hollywood genre piece. Wonderful music and cinematography and Robert Mitchum is unforgettable as the demonic preacher with a hidden agenda."

1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,One of the best films of all time.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,One of the greatest films ever! And Orson Welles' best film - better than Citizen Kane. The predecessor of so many movie tropes its a pity so many can only now view it as an amalgamation of cliches.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Otra genialidad de Orson Welles, merece mas que cinco estrellas, con uno de los inicios mas impactantes y de una sola toma hechos en la historia del cine."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"It was Welles' penance. If he could bring it in on time and on budget he would get better choices. Well he did and the studio dumped it. The joke was on them, though, as it's a stunning film."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"OMG, the opening sequence! 'OMG' has finally found its gasp-inducing match. An achievement in every aspect of film-making.Delightful!"
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"As long as you don't find Charlton Heston playing a Mexican too distracting, you're in for quite possibly the most intense psychological thriller of the black-and-white era."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Essential to watch for any serious film fan or filmmaker. Incredible shots and innovative direction bring Orson Wells genius out forefront!
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Uma obra-prima de Orson Welles, mesmo não saindo do jeito que ele planejou (já nessa época os estúdios eram problemáticos), ainda sim é um belo Noir (mesmo abrindo mão alguns elementos tradicionais do gênero) e o emblemático plano-sequência de abertura."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Love Charlton Heston, and Orson Welles' acting is excellent as usual. The shots are killer. It's not that they don't make 'em like they used to, they just don't make 'em like Orson Welles used to."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"An effortlessly stylish, thoughtfully emotional Crime/Thriller/Noir which feels suspiciously like a selection of previously separated narratives, now combined into a glorious affair of wonder for the mind and the eye; each step in the films winding continuation being more captivating than the last."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Personally I believe this to be Welles' best film over Citizen Kane.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Vargas: ""Captain, you won't have any trouble with me.""Quinlan: ""You bet your sweet life I won't."""
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"A policeman's job is only easy in a police state.  This is an amazing film - excellent acting, direction, dialogue - I highly recommend it."

1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Touch of Evil defines noir.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Another Orson Welles brigade of artistic mastery and stylish execution. Touch of Evil is suspenseful and intense with a very intriguing story-line.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"a funky film noir, fast"
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Absolutely phenomenal film.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Stylistically pioneering and dramatically riveting, Touch of Evil is a twisted, menacing thriller and a feast for the eyes."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Excellent movie! Watched it because all the low key photography that Wells used. This is a must for photographers/filmographer...
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Probably the best Noir ever, at least, the best I've seen yet."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,LiÃ§Ã£o singular como nÃ£o se deve tratar o espectador como um atrasado mental.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Amazing in every aspect I'd argue and say this is Orson Well's best movie.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Orson Welles at his best. Even Heston's typical overacting cannot prevent this film form being great.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,An amazingly bold film for its time with still a lot of power even in this new century.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Masterpiece - every shot is perfect.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"It has a lot of flaws, but the cinematography and Orson Welles' amazing performance--one of the very best I've ever seen, are enough for me to give it a perfect score anyways."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Hollywood doesn't make films like this anymore because it doesn't produce directors like Orson Welles anymore. Hollywood is dead, but then again, unfortunately so is Welles."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Masterful direction. The king of the B-movies. Plus Charlton Heston as a Mexican!
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Saw the longer, 1998-release version of this (the one Welles intended), and it's fantastic."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Incredible...one of the most suspenseful openings to a movie ever.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,I'm not sure which is better: Orson Welles's performance or his direction.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Oavsett vad Orson Welles ""egentligen"" ville göra så är det här hans bästa film. Mörk, svettig och rå slår den ner som en bomb i vilken filmsoffa som helst."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Better than Citizen Kane? Yes. Obviously. Duh. Why? Where else can you get Heston speaking 'mexican' and with that fantastic fake tan? Janet Leigh being menaced by lesbian bikers? Orson Welles in the greatest fat suit of all time? Dennis Weaver. DENNIS WEAVER.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Have you hear? Welles makes some amazing films. This is one of them.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Welles brilhante como sempre.

1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Proof that Orson Welles had other great movies besides Citizen Kane.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Is it possible for Welles to not direct an amazing scene?
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Great Movie. Welles best movie in my opinion. The only problem I had was Charlton Heston playing a Mexican. Once I got over that, the movie was very enjoyable. A must see!"
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Otra genialidad de Orson Welles, merece mas que cinco estrellas, con uno de los inicios mas impactantes y de una sola toma hechos en la historia del cine."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Awesome opening shot, the duration lasted a while. I wonder how they did it."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"My introduction to Orson Welles, and it couldn't have been a better one. Welles creates a masterfully executed and hugely entertaining portrait of innocence and abuse of power, presented through strong writing, suspense, convincing acting and of course the legendary opening tracking shot. Memorable."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Brilliant crime movie with some of the most celebrated cinematography ever, it's an intense film for its time."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"So good, you even buy the fact that Charlton Heston plays a Mexican. Imaginatively directed, admirably acted, and insidiously suspenseful."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Low budget noir done right.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Another Orson Welles masterpiece.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Great Movie! The Cinematography is amazing!
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Behind Citizen Kane as my favorite Orson Welles film.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Many say Citizen Kane is Welles' best. I suppose I'm in the minority by saying this is his masterpiece.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Every bit as good Citizen Kane or The Trial. In fact, it's probably more visually interesting than Kane, though the material is trashier and has a bit less depth."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Simply one of the best films ever.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Suspenseful film noir with superb work from Heston, Welles and Leigh."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Disguised as a noir B movie, this is Welles' masterpiece for me, far from ""Citizen Kane""."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"This film is said to have ended film-noir, because it is so dirty and bleak."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Quinlan: Come on, read my future for me. Tanya: You haven't got any. Quinlan: Hmm? What do you mean? Tanya: Your future's all used up."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Meu filme favorito de Orson Welles e um dos melhores films noir da história. Filmado com maestria. O cara brinca com a câmera aqui. Vários 'plano-sequência' épicos. De fato, Orson Welles estava muito à frente de seu tempo, muito."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Indeed a classic, one can not fail to delight the many elements that permeate this amazing film. See it as quick as possible if you are a real film geek!"

1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"An odd, compelling, and dark noir masterpiece that I prefer to ""Citizen Kane"". So shoot me."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Really well done. :)
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,This film is the real McCoy
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Charlton Heston is a mexican? goes to show how insensative hollywood was back then. But that didn't stop me from liking this movie. An impressive thriller by the great Orson Welles.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Kane was amazing. Ambersons was brilliant, but this is Welles finest film."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Film noir at its darkest. Great opening crane shot. One of Welles best performances. The rest of the outstanding cast also turn in excellent performances.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"While this Welles picture didn't have quite the historical impact of Citizen Kane, for my dollar it's just as entertaining. I still marvel at the technical prowess displayed in that opening sequence."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Fantastic pace and tension throughout, with amazing camera shots and use of lighting."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"many say that ""touch of evil"", not citizen Kane is Welles' finest work. I'd have to agree. the prototype for crooked cop movies."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Brilliantly balanced. An effortless weaving of plot, character, and theme topped off with a fascinating visual progression."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"A stunning portrait of corruption and abuse of power, Touch of Evil gives Orson Welles a broad remit to flourish his directorial genius."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,The finest film noir. Period
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"The genius of Orson Welles!! a masterpiece in film-noir. With or without his huge frame (literally!), Welles towers over this movie with his stunning performance!"
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Excellent film noir. Great cast.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,A brilliantly told stylishly made film noir classic with possibly the greatest opening shot in film history.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"The end of classical noir era and another example of Welles' genius, I must say. Needs to be seen as words can hardly describe. After opening scene/shot, you will realize (or not), what you are dealing with."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Absolute masterpiece. My pick over Citizen Cane.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,An excellent suspense film!
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,By far the greatest thing that Orson Welles has ever done.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"An American Classic, an under-watched film, its got its flaws, but every good film does, like thee supporting cast is a little weak. But over all a great film."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"I'd read about that opening tracking shot, and it really was possibly the most incredible shot ever."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Great! Special memories watching it with Brian in New York several years ago!!!!
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Really an excellent film, everything from the acting to directing is great, especially since Orson Welles' directing, writing, and performance that blows your mind! Then the six or so minute long shot, come on now, fuckin' amazing."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Best cinematography ever?
0.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"This was an extremely disappointing movie. Uncle Chuck, Janet Leigh, Orson Welles, you'd think it'd be a surefire thing, but damn, it was just boring and bleah."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Note the continuous opening shot that follows the protagonists out of the building, into their car, and around an entire city block in one uncut shot at the beginning of the film. Welles used a crane mounted on a building's roof to accomplish this."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Orson Welles is fucking brilliant
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Good stuff. Haha, love the references to reefer as if it's the new heroin."
0.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Man this was BORING. Why is it considered a classic?
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"The nail in film noir's coffin. 2 years before Hitch had Janet Leigh hauled up in a seedy motel, Orson showed us the lovely lady in her underwear first."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"La mejor pelicula clase B en la historia del cine, formalmente admirable, con un reparto excelente y con un plano secuencia inicial que hay que ver para creer."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Great film, with top performance and a genius script, one of the first and best corrupt cop drama."
0.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,The first scene: genius. The rest of the film: garbage.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,A terrific film and the perfect way to end the film-noir cycle. Welles' best.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,All of Orson Welles' movies should default to 5 stars.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Not only is this film brilliant on all counts, it's also reason number 2 why Dennis Weaver is one of the all-time underrated acting talents."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Un pur chef-d'oeuvre : le film noir absolu que transcende une mise en scene de genie. La scene du viol vaut largement celle de la douche dans Psychose.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"maybe 2nd best Welles, and yes with Chuck Heston as a Mexican"
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"The opening shot alone is worth buying the movie. Maybe it's a better movie than Citizen Kane, maybe not... apples and oranges. I will say it is probably the best film noir ever made... even with Charlton Heston playing a mexican."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,I still can't believe that's Orson Welles..
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,*the* film noir classic
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Touch of Evil is more impressive than Citizen Kane. His use of the camera instills the perverseness of the story and the characters. The best of film noir.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,best starting plan for a movie. ever. (was for a long time a record: 20 minutes without cut). a masterpiece.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"A very good 'film noir' film with excellent direction and a commanding performance from Welles, its only real flaw is Charlton Heston is cinema's least convincing Mexican."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Only Welles could take a trashy pulp novel and turn it into a piece of art. Genius. And just listen to that dialogue: ""You framed that boy - framed him!"" Classic."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Orson Welles' other best movie.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"For me this film and Citizen Kane stand almost side by side in movie history greatness. A well-crafted film noir of depth and mood directed seemlessly by, if not the greatest, the most important filmmaker in cinema history, Mr. Orson Welles."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,The ultimate Film Noir film. So intense it feels longer than 108 minutes. The best scenes are the beginning and the ending which is ideal for any film. A lot of fun to watch and basically flawless and perfect.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,One of Welles best. A cinematic masterpiece and arguably the last great film noir.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Another masterpiece by Orson Welles that was taken out of his hands. Here we have a murder mystery in which Charlton Heson plays a Mexican narcotics officer and Orson Welles plays a crooked investigator who will do anything to get his way. Janet Leigh is outstanding as Heston's wife.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Aside from the obvious well done writing, editing and shots way ahead of its time, I'd have to say what I enjoyed most was how fat Orson Welles was and how badly ""Mexican"" Charlton Heston looked."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"""What does it matter what people say about you?"""
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,A brilliant film noir. Perhaps not as ground breaking as Citizen Kane but Touch of Evil certainly stands out as one of the best of its kind and once again shows just how great of a writer and director Orson Welles truly is.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"I don't care which cut you see, the original theatrical or the ""director's cut"", just see it. Charlton Heston...as a Mexican! What more could you want?"
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,One of my favorite American made films. I'm in love with Orson.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"I love the story, and I just can't enough of Orson Welles's extraordinary cinematography."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"A superlative work of genius, from its bravura opening to its low-key final shot, this works on all levels, as only truly great films can."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Classic very well thought out - great concept
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Despite a few questionable casting choices, Touch of Evil remains a technical masterpiece and a wonderful example of Welles' fecund imagination. The story starts with a bang and never lets up, perfectly balancing noir influenced abstraction with a sense of gritty reality."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Brilliant. Fast dialogue, dramatic camera angles, Italians playing Mexicans; everything you could ask for in a film."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,One of my favorite movies of all time. The end of the classic noir era as only Orson can do it.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"The late great Welles' seedy,oily B-picture.Full of cinematic touches only the big man could conjure up.Police corruption and brutality down Mexico way...the bravura opening tracking shot...the litter filled grimy streets...the menacing Mercedes Cambridge...Marlene...He vas hellava man!"
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,This movie is just fantastic! Beautiful b/w cinematography and such wonderful odd characters. Unfortunately Welles's rough cut is missing.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,My favourite Orson Welles film
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Another Welles masterpiece. An amazing feat of acting, direction, cinematography, and writing. I liked it the first time through and loved it the second time!"
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Just get past Charlton Heston's poor acting and this film is a masterpiece.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Orson Welles is a genius, as always!"
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,The opening scene goes on forever without a cut.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Truly inspirational film with magnificent acting, grossly gloomy plot, and KICK ASS cinematography way ahead of its time."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,This is one of the great noirs. The newer cut (based on Orson Welles notes) is brilliant.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"""A policeman's job is only easy in a police state."""
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,an absolute masterpiece!
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,gripping and in parts terrifying
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Brilliant....this movie tops any other crime noir film to come from the original wave of noir films. It's dark and gritty and creepy and at times surreal and hallucinatory. How Orson Welles was veritably ignored for the genius that he obviously was in his time is beyond me.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Fantastic movie. The acting is top notch and the directing is fantastic. One sub character that was great was the night porter of the hotel.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,orsen welles is awesome!
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Orson Welles at his best. Brilliant direction and cinematography - the opening scene is a masterpiece. Classic noir - just ignore that Charlton Heston is supposed to be Mexican...
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Incredible film that feels like it should have been made in the 70s or 80s with the themes discussed.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Mesmerizing camera work is the most immediate feature of this Orson Welles production. Like Citizen Kane, the heart of this story is the unraveling of a powerful figure (in this case, a police detective). This is a smart film that creates uncomfortable situations with great skill."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,In my opinion Welles best directorial display. The first sequence is the best sequence in film ever. A classic noir film with all the best elements. Superb
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"now, this is a true B&W; movie... no guessing around"
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Quite possibly my favorite film of all time, a film that often makes me cry because it is just such a monumental artisitc acheivement."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Ultimativ medrivende krimi, hvor man hele tiden bliver i tvivl om, hvem man skal holde med. Fantastisk åbningsscene hvor kameraet i ét langt skud følger hovedpersonens bil ved grænseovergangen indtil.."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Great film! Go watch it! Orson Welles is awesome!
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Suspend disbelief enough to allow Charlton Heston to play a Mexican detective, and you will be able to enjoy one of my all-time favorite noir thrillers. This film grabs you with its spectacular first tracking shot (filmed as one long, continuous take) and never lets go."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Pelicula de fronteras: Mexico-USA, Cielo-Infierno, Dia-Noche, Amor-Odio. El son de una pianola y el ""adios"" de la Dietrich me alcanzan para saber de q lado estoy yo. Gracias Orson por tanta magia."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Wow. A Film Noir powerhouse!
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,The opening shot in this film is one of the best I've ever seen.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,My review is based off the re-cut version. I thought it was directed brilliantly with such confidence and expertise.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Orson Welles is a filmmaking master. That is all.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"My all-time favorite Orson Welles movie. Sure, it has Charlton Heston playing a Mexican with an American accent, but otherwise it works."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Cracking good noir entertainment.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Charlton Heston plays a Mexican detective, and does a good acting job. Two feats never to be repeated in cinematic history, to my knowledge."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Very amazing movie... good for watching over and over again.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Haunting latter-day film-noir from Orson Welles, who is unquestionably one of the all-time great actors AND directors. Chartlon Heston and Janet Leigh and both surprisingly good, too."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,uggghhhhh... nana nana.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,maybe the best NOIR movie i have ever seen........ GOOD plot........... Great Characters........ Sinister......... Intense.... GREAT!!!!

1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,The definitive film noir
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Citizen Kane or Touch of Evil. Which is a better movie? Do we ever have to decide?
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Only Orson Welles could make a masterpiece out of a film starring Charlton Heston as a Mexican cop.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,This movie shook me the first time i saw it. Not already the 60's but you are going to see some extreme sequence there. A group of junkies try to rape and give drug to a pregnant woman that after wake up in a bed with a dead man staring over her.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"A jolt to the system. This movie reminds me so much of great moments I'd seen in Repulsion or Mean Streets or Blue Velvet, except it came first."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,We'll miss you Chuck

1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Spectacular. The film that ended the film noir era. I find it to be more entertaining that 'Citizen Kane', but it's not as transcendent due to genre conventions How can you go wrong with Welles in a massive fatsuit? RIP Charlton Heston."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,The director's cut is the superior edition. This is one of Welles' best films for so many reasons. Charlton Heston as a Mexican!

1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,One of the GREATEST film noir's I have seen... And has the best tracking shot in a film until Goodfellas. Amazing cast and Charlton Heston playing a Mexican is a must see!
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"I love this movie. This movie is perhaps the best noir movie ever made. The long opening shot is a real treat. The preformances suprise. It is almost a who is who of the era. Orson Welles as the slimy, always sweaing, overweight cop is incredible."

1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Excellent from the opening long tracking shot to Marlene Dietrich's final piece of dialogue. The only low point for me is the irritating jumpy motel nightwatchman, but that is nitpicking. An enthralling, and visually superior, film noir."

1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Orson Welle's best acting in any film and the epitomy of what film noir is all about. Gritty and compelling. It also has perhaps the best opening long shot of any film ever made.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Star filled and well played film even if Orson Welles had problems with Universal during production this is a masterpiece of a grim film. The ironic ending still is extremely effective.

1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Classic conspracy twist film. Not only the best of its genre but one of the greatest films of all time.

0.0,before_midnight_2013,This was one of the worst films I have ever watched. It is like watching a couple have a running argument for 100 minutes. It must have had a budget of $500!

1.0,before_midnight_2013,"I pity the poor soul who may have watched this prior to the previous installments, these three chapters give way to the most important periods in life. Adolescence, maturity, and pessimism. You feel like you've known these two as long as they've known each other."

0.0,before_midnight_2013,I found this movie to be completely monotonous. The husband and wife spent endless hours bantering on and on about nothing. It was the first movie in a long time that I was let down by the Rotten Tomato ratings.

1.0,before_midnight_2013,An astounding achievement... Perhaps (ok certainly) helped by the fact that I viewed the two previous instalments within 3 days of each other -- which enabled me to care more deeply for these characters than I would have with a typical 90 minutes -- that's it. Fascinating!
1.0,before_midnight_2013,"It's easy to forget how thought-provoking and fresh these films are because Richard Linklater's direction is so elegant and modest, and Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy's act with such believability, delivering strong intellectual perceptions on love, marriage, and lasting relationships."

1.0,alien,Best sci fi ever? Quite possibly.
1.0,alien,Perhaps there is no better mixture of horror and sci-Fi as Alien.
1.0,alien,They'll be calling this film a seminal sci/fi horror masterpiece 75 years from now.

The acting is great John Hurt and Sigourney Weaver and the special effects WOW!!
1.0,alien,a must have un the colection
1.0,alien,One of the best suspense build ups of all time. And one of the best horror climaxes. Visceral and with great feminist undertones.
1.0,alien,Ya la había visto pero hoy la vi en Blu Ray y me volvió a encantar. Un clásico de los clásicos.
1.0,alien,"One of the first modern films to combine horror and science fiction, and highly successful at it. This film is incredible for how it does so much with relatively little, and for being one of the most visually striking films of its age. A classic for a reason. One of my favourites."

1.0,alien,"Alien is without a doubt one of the most influential Sci-fi films ever made-- up there with Star Wars, Blade Runner, and The Terminator. The performances are extraordinary, and the plot is highly refined. My only problem is that some plot points seem unnecessarily tacked on."
1.0,alien,One of the best horror movies ever made. I know a lot of people don't see this movie as a horror flick but just because it's set in space and is in the future is moot. The fact it makes you sit on the edge of your seat and jump at every turn is what mades it amazing.

1.0,alien,Best movie of all time

1.0,his_girl_friday,The classic gender-twisted version of The Front Page play which was previously filmed in 1931 and remade in 1974 & 1988. Part of The Criterion Collection with the pre-release version of the 1931 film adaption of the play and on Blu-ray. A must watch film... All involved are in great form.

1.0,his_girl_friday,Simply one of the funniest movies ever made.
0.0,his_girl_friday,I watched this movie because it is considered one of the classic American films. His Girl Friday shows that the definition of classic needs to be reconsidered. The movie is about men's power over women through and through. How many stars? Negative 3 on a scale of 1-5.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"The back and forth dialogue, the manipulative machinations of the plot, and the birth of the unromantic comedy. The thing that's most surprising about this classic is the style with which Howard Hawks pulls it all off."

1.0,his_girl_friday,Wow! This movie was a lot of fun and really holds up well. Grant is the apex of charm and wit.
1.0,his_girl_friday,Best screwball comedy I have seen yet. Howard Hawks is utterly brilliant and before his time in this. Grant is phenomenal. I could watch this movie every day for the rest of my life and still laugh at all the jokes.
1.0,his_girl_friday,Yet another Hawks classic comedy. Funny -- and FAST!

1.0,his_girl_friday,"Hilarious...one brilliantly written line with perfect delivery after another, coming at such a pace that sometimes it's hard to even catch half of them. Comedy tends not to be timeless, but most of this movie definitely is."

1.0,his_girl_friday,One of the best ever--the writing is amazing and Rosalind Russell & Cary Grant have such great tempo with their lines
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Great Pacing, Great Acting, Great Movie! (leaves you breathless!)"
1.0,his_girl_friday,"""His Girl Friday"" comes from a time when cinematic humor could still rest upon clever wordplay and onscreen charisma, rather than outrageousness. And it comes from a time when it was still acceptable build outraged, cynical subtext into a light comedy."
1.0,his_girl_friday,Great Dialogue and Great Acting what more can you ask for.

1.0,his_girl_friday,"The dialogue is rapid-fire and full of funny lines and references. (As I recall, Cary Grant has a line in which he mentions the name, Archie Leach, which was Cary Grant's name in real life.) Rosalind Russell is so lively and plays her role with fine finesse!"

1.0,his_girl_friday,"Don't bother watching the preview. It doesn't capture any of the snappy wit of the movie, or charm of the plot. And this is one witty, charming classic."

1.0,his_girl_friday,"This movie is obviously a classic for a reason. Super fast, awesome dialogue. I love Cary Grant!!"
1.0,his_girl_friday,"HI-larious! Cary Grant is amazing, charming and cocky all at the same time - he's obnoxious but you still cheer for him. They don't make them like this anymore - much to the detriment of modern movie-goers."
1.0,his_girl_friday,"I never tire of this film. They talk so fast and so wittily and never miss a beat. Cary Grant is phenomenally charming, as always, and Rosalind Russell is quite a match for him. The minor characters also add a lot to the comedic value of the film."
1.0,his_girl_friday,One of the best screw ball comedies I've ever seen.
1.0,his_girl_friday,Love it. Howard Hawks. Fast talking. Cool characters. Tons of in-jokes.

1.0,his_girl_friday,Everyone should see it once...though i have seen it multiple times
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Classic Howard Hawks film with Rosalind Russell and Cary Grant firing off their dialogue like machine patter. The script is witty, the plot immense, and the stars shine through it all. A real gem of the 1940s."
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Simply put; Grant, Russell, Lederer and Hawks all at the top of their game. Absolutely one of the greatest comedies ever made. Whip yerself like that monk from Da Vinci if you haven't seen it!"

1.0,his_girl_friday,"Funny, quick and witty dialog, amazing acting and a great story. What's not to love about this movie. Russell and Grant are great together. And even Melvin Douglas is great as the poor, slow on the uptake gent that Russell thinks she wants to marry. They really don't make them like this anymore."
1.0,his_girl_friday,"One of the greatest movies ever. I'm pretty sure that if I had been born a lot earlier, Cary Grant and I could have had a thing...pretty sure."
1.0,his_girl_friday,"funny,fast...total entertainment...."

1.0,his_girl_friday,Smart and witty. What a great story. Well conceived and executed. A thinking film.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Premise: ""A newspaper editor uses every trick in the book to keep his ace reporter ex-wife from remarrying.""He taught me everything I know. The fastest comedy (the script) ever made."
0.0,his_girl_friday,was bored. cary grant made very few movies i actually like.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"The wittiest and fastest paced (dialogue wise) movie I've ever seen. Movies like this don't exist anymore sadly. Highly recommended, if only for Carey Grant's performance"

1.0,his_girl_friday,Classic film for all involved. The lightning speed witty banter reminds me how bland the dialogue is in most movies nowadays.
1.0,his_girl_friday,The dialog is the music.
1.0,his_girl_friday,Eden najboljsih filmov vseh casov!
1.0,his_girl_friday,2 years before Casablanca but twice the lines
1.0,his_girl_friday,Hilarious fast paced comedy. They just don't make movies like this anymore.
1.0,his_girl_friday,It's always bothered me that Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell didn't make any other movies together.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Classic! The dialogue, the acting...all while looking effortlessly gorgeous. The old cliche that ""they don't make 'em like they used to"" is SO true. The Grant/Russell chemistry is amazing."
1.0,his_girl_friday,Great movie with lightning speed dialogue.
1.0,his_girl_friday,la mayor burla al periodismo de la historia. los dialogos son mas rapidos q disparos de Tommy Gun! Es una de las mejores comedias q he visto (si no es la mejor). Creo q solo se le compara Dr. Strangelove...
1.0,his_girl_friday,Cary Grant. Rosalind Russell. Dialogue so fast it'll make your head spin. This movie is the gold standard for screwball romantic comedies.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"There is nothing I don't like about this movie. It's funny, exciting, topical, and even a little touching. Plus, the acting is unbeatable and the liberties taken with the original play really enhance the story and make it far more interesting."
1.0,his_girl_friday,cary grant is always awesome
1.0,his_girl_friday,The thing that really makes this film pop was the chemistry and competition between Grant and Russell. Much of the film is adlibbed and was encouraged by Hawks. The best scene is when they're in the bar sitting around the table...the entire scene was shot in one take and is 90% adlib. Brilliant!
1.0,his_girl_friday,Try to keep up with the dialog in this forerunner to today's romantic comedy! The pace is pitch-perfect and Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell are divine.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"You ain't sweet on this picture show? That's a lot of hooey. I'd put my arm in a fire for this movie, up to here!"

1.0,his_girl_friday,By far the funniest film from the Screwball era. Both Rosalind Russelland Cary Grant are mind blowingly funny.
1.0,his_girl_friday,The best film ever of a now extinct genre. Many have tried to revive the screwball comedy and all have failed. The perfect version of very good story.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"One of those great, razor-sharp comedies they just don't make anymore."
1.0,his_girl_friday,cary grant....howard hawks.....most badass rapid fire dialouge ever.....badass
1.0,his_girl_friday,"An witty, clever comedy that was entertaining from beginning to end."
1.0,his_girl_friday,"With characters moving at speed and brilliant dialogue being delivered at a machine gun rate, this is one of the great screwball comedies and a kick in the teeth for the many actresses such as Katharine Hepburn and Claudette Colbert who turned down the role of Hildy Johnson."
1.0,his_girl_friday,"A perfect comedy. Intelligent, cynical, rapid-fire dialogue, a uniformly excellent cast with the stars on top of their game. A stage adaptation that never feels stagey and that gives us a great battling love story to boot. Showing at the NFT as part of the Screwball Women season."
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Simple and charming. The wit crackles. Cary Grant is both debonair and absolutely hilarious, and Rosalind Russel is tough, brilliant, and vulnerable all at once."
1.0,his_girl_friday,This explains my love of newspeople. Cary Grant will be my love in heaven.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"clever, incredibly quick paced newspaper comedy about Grant trying to win back ex-wife."
1.0,his_girl_friday,Best screwball comedy ever. Grant and Russels dialogue is absolutely unbelievable it is so quick. Also Ralph Bellamy deserves a mention as the brilliant straight man to those two.
1.0,his_girl_friday,A Classic. Cary Grant is amazingly devious and Rosalind Russell is taking none of it.
1.0,his_girl_friday,really really great. witty and clever and fast. and the last half hour was so incredibly funny.
1.0,his_girl_friday,One of the all time greats! and one of the funniest movies ever made!
1.0,his_girl_friday,Amazing movie...dialogues are great..superbly acted...totally hilarious...not a second to lose

1.0,his_girl_friday,"Amazing dialogue, rapid-fire pacing and timeless wit. Not to be missed!"
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Fast paced and VERY funny! Great back-and-forth banter & bickering between ""Walter"" and ""Hilde"". One of my absolute favorites!"

1.0,his_girl_friday,A comedy that amazingly has 100% spectacular writing and acting! This movie is a blast to watch and has all the right elements to make it a late gem of the screwball comedy era.
1.0,his_girl_friday,The fast-talking movie to end all fast-talking movies. It changed the face of American comedy and holds up so well it could make a killing if released today.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Howard Hawks is a God. This movie is a train. It doesn't let anything stop it up. A woman jumps out of a window and in less than thirty seconds, it returns it's machine-gun pace and witty dialogue. ...why can't I be more like Cary Grant? ...oh yeah, I'm hideous and completely lack any charm."
1.0,his_girl_friday,The best of the best.
1.0,his_girl_friday,Possibly the FUNNIEST movie ever made. Fact! Sure is fast....
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Brilliant, hilarious movie."
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Some of the best ad-libbed dialog ever. Wonderful tempo, and Roz Russell is phenomenal (Cary Grant's not too shabby either)."
1.0,his_girl_friday,The first 40 minutes might be the best stuff Hawks and Grant have ever done.

1.0,his_girl_friday,"If you think you talk fast, watch this movie and compare. I love this movie."
1.0,his_girl_friday,Progressive cinema in the sense that it portrays modern gender roles for both female reporters and actresses being able to keep up with the male counterparts. Also progressive in the delivery of lightning speed banter.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Best fast-talking, classic Cary Grant comedy. If you don't listen UP you'll miss half the jokes. Just classically perfect!"
1.0,his_girl_friday,Seriously one of the best movies ever made. Lois Lane's character was inspired by this movie.
1.0,his_girl_friday,Classic film with humor that holds out today.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Inventive and vexing, the former for the time, the latter because, well, then a war happened, leaving people like me sitting around holding their dorks wunnerin: where could we have gone from there?"
1.0,his_girl_friday,Nothing less than five stars explains it. A completely entertaining and engauging movie. Cary Grant steals the show as always.
1.0,his_girl_friday,Talk about fast deliveries! This insanely fast paced comedy raises the bar regarding witty scripts. Cary Grant and the beautiful Rosalind Russell. Delightful.  The grandady of Gilmore Girls (if that ever helps).
1.0,his_girl_friday,Wonderfully witty and fast-paced. Cary Grant is superb (as always) and Rosalind Russell is great as well. Great film!
1.0,his_girl_friday,Howard Hawks doing it the way he duz best. Cary Grant and Roselind russell sparkle.
1.0,his_girl_friday,You can't stop laughing!
1.0,his_girl_friday,Hawks' fast comedy is just about the sharpest film I've seen. Russell and Grant were fantastic. They were so full of energy that it could only be actors with their level of skill who could make their entertaining exchanges work.
1.0,his_girl_friday,Perfectly written and performed screwball comedy. The fastest movie ever made.
1.0,his_girl_friday,There might be two lines of dialog in the whole film that don't make me laugh.

1.0,his_girl_friday,One of the best examples of the fast talking sarcastic romantic comedies of the era. Holds up with the best of them.
1.0,his_girl_friday,Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell at their wise cracking fast talking best. Nearly 70 years after it was first released this is still hilarious.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Rosalind Russell set the bar very high for smart, sassy, fast talking broads. Truly a classic and worth seeing if you haven't."
1.0,his_girl_friday,Holy Shit! There's someone who talks more than AND faster than me!

1.0,his_girl_friday,"smart, fast, funny. try to keep up with hildy and walter."
1.0,his_girl_friday,I have rented this many times because I thought this was a great Cary Grant movie.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Fabulously witty, Grant's most funniest performance in a lightning paced newspaper comedy. Features some of Grant's distinctive ad libs. When asked to describe his ex-wife's new fiancee, misplaces his line and instead comes up with ""Oh he looks like that film actor, Ralph Bellamy"". Classic."
1.0,his_girl_friday,fast-paced madness - Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell are fantastic. How can they talk that fast?
1.0,his_girl_friday,I think that I learned how to be a woman by watching old Rosalind Russell films. She rocks - always one scarcastic comment away from being a bitch but still so sweet!
1.0,his_girl_friday,this movie is pure fun especially if you catch the hidden jokes.
1.0,his_girl_friday,Grant and Russell are spectacular in this hit from 1940. The fast paced script and the obvious chemistry between Russell and Grant provides for a wonderful movie. A MUST for all Grant/Russell lovers!
1.0,his_girl_friday,A perfect example of it's kind. Fast witted dialogue that overlaps brilliantly just as it would do in real life. Grant & Russell have great chemistry and Hawks keeps things moving at such a pace you feel the tension build even though it is very much a comedy.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Cary Grant at his best, there really aren't movie star like him any more."
1.0,his_girl_friday,Brilliant all the way around.

1.0,his_girl_friday,Cary Grant was always at his best playing a smooth-talking rogue. This fast-paced intellectual comic masterpiece is one of his best. Rosalind Russell is his match (though much of her motivation seems sexist in this day and age).

1.0,la_confidential,I can say with no regret that L.A. Confidential has one of the greatest scripts of all time. Practically every other line has a subtler meaning. The acting is terrific and its movies like these that make me wonder why some of these actors aren't as famous as they should be.

1.0,la_confidential,Honestly worth anyone's time to watch!

1.0,la_confidential,EPIC is an understatement...
1.0,la_confidential,One of the greatest films ever made.
1.0,la_confidential,"One of the best movies of the 90's, and perhaps the greatest detective mystery story ever told on film. The entire cast knocks it out of the park, and the script never skips a beat, making for infinite re-watchability. A modern classic and truly brilliant noir."

1.0,la_confidential,This film is a masterpiece. One of the best crime dramas of all time. I definetly had a ball watching this. Great work all done by a masterful team of cast and crew. Director Curtis Hanson puts real effort and detail to the period and locations in his film and it shows all so effortlessly.
1.0,la_confidential,"It's all mind games for the criminal underworld of Las Angeles. Oh, and plenty of shotgun and smooth jazz by Chet Baker."
1.0,la_confidential,Unquestionably one of the best crime dramas ever laid out on the silver screen. The story features a spectacular narrative that really puts you in the middle of the era it represents. Spacey is wonderful as usual and this was a coming out of sorts for two terrific imports in Pearce and Crowe
1.0,la_confidential,Probably the greatest LA-Noir film I've watched.
1.0,la_confidential,Russell Crowe at his best.

1.0,la_confidential,"Brilliant. Acting, writing, directing. Loved everything about it."
1.0,la_confidential,"Hey, Titanic is better than this movie according to the wizards of smart in Hollywood. Uh-huh, and The Godfather Part III is superior to I & II."
1.0,la_confidential,"Every performance fits and is executed perfectly. In my opinion this film contains one the ten best scripts of the '1990s and in the same vain as Chinatown, L.A. Confidential stands out as one of the best examples of what a Neo Noir should be."

1.0,la_confidential,A rare gem of a film. It was robbed of the Best Picture Oscar by the inferior and very cheesy Titanic.
1.0,la_confidential,One of the best movies I have ever seen. This is a great 50's crime mystery with flawless acting. This could be one of Crowe's best roles as he nails the troubled cop perfectly. If you pay attention to this slightly complicated plot you will love it.
1.0,la_confidential,"Add it to the list of movies enhanced by Kevin Spacey's amazing acting abilities, and the list of great cop movies."

1.0,la_confidential,I absolutely love it. It's thrilling and dramatic throughout and the acting is first-rate. Definitely deserved more Oscars. The only thing I wonder is the exact importance of Basinger's character. She certainly doesn't seem pivotal to the plot...
1.0,la_confidential,"This should have been 1997's movie of the year. Cameron's ""The Titanic"", in comparison, is just a sinking ship."
1.0,la_confidential,Definitely one of the best detective stories ever made.

1.0,la_confidential,"A gripping story filled with more engaging characters to study than you can count, L.A. Confidential is the most versatile mystery around. It contains something to keep everyone entertained, and its depth allows for it to easily be enjoyed through multiple viewings."

1.0,the_dark_knight,Favorite movie of all time.
1.0,the_dark_knight,"Awesome movie. Some elements of the plot were confusing at first, however, but maybe that's because I'm not a hardcore Batman fan (like how Batman knew which cops were crooked at the hospital, until afterwards).

1.0,the_dark_knight,"I believe this is an example for other superhero movies to portray what kind of rich, complex heights can be achieved with a genre some people have little confidence or interest in.

1.0,the_dark_knight,*BWWWWWWAAAAAAAAAMMMMMMM*

1.0,the_dark_knight,I don't have to explain why this movie is amazing. 5/5
1.0,army_of_shadows,"This is not a film, this is a remorseless testimony. 'army of shadows' will mark you like (very) few films. Never did I see such a cold-blooded way to shoot a film, and never did I see such unbearable tension. No one but Kessel could have written it, and no one but Melville have directed it I guess."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Melville captured me with his long study of characters. These characters are freedom fighters in the resistance during WWII. The audience cannot help but be impressed by the conviction in these fighters. I want to see it again.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"ARMY OF SHADOWS is one of the greatest war films I've ever seen. It is a melancholy, deep and honest depiction of desperate people in a dark period of history. Riveting all the way through, this is an indisputable masterpiece from the great French filmmaker Jean-Pierre Melville."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"As of today, Army of Shadows is the greatest film I've ever seen. Never have I been as paralyzed as I was by a film's greatness. Genius flows in every frame."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"One of the great films about the French resistance, Army of Shadows was not well thought of when it was first released in 1969, but is now thought of as one of Melville's greatest films. Riveting."
1.0,army_of_shadows,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"An engrossing, brutally frank story of bleak isolation and paranoid dread. A heartbreaking masterpiece."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"A work of precision, Army of Shadows while ill paced, is a profoundly philosophical investigation of humanity, morality and bravery."
1.0,army_of_shadows,as good as it gets as a portrait of courage and an anti-faschist polemic
1.0,army_of_shadows,my favorite french film
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Army of Shadows is a dark, harrowing & brutal depiction of the French Resistance with unforgettable scenes of heroism & danger."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Beautifully shot, gloriously atmospheric, and meticulously gripping. A rich film about the underground French Resistance during WWII. I'd rank it up with ""Battle for Algiers,"" ""Z,"" and ""The Manchurian Candidate"" for great political thrillers."
1.0,army_of_shadows,All I can say is wow.
1.0,army_of_shadows,One of the best war films you're likely to find.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"A film to be watched like wine is to be drank. Saviour this for all its subtleties, nuances and textures... it is so rich. Go slow and have patience."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Best film about any Resistance movement I have seen in a long time.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Slow movie but a great one about the french resistance.
0.0,army_of_shadows,Not something Id watch more then once
1.0,army_of_shadows,The best movie I've ever seen. No other movie has ever made me feel the amount of tension that Army of Shadows has. As close as anyone could ever get to being a member of the French Resistance.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Encore un classique !
1.0,army_of_shadows,Supremely realistic film that gets under your skin and stays with you long after the credits have rolled. One of the masterpieces of French Cinema and one of the best films I've ever seen. 9.5/10
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Melville is known more for his ""Le Doulos"" and ""Le Samourai"" but this brilliant film focussing on the French resistance is a rare piece of Cinematic genius.Multi layered,suspenseful,realistic and ultimately cynical,this is a keeper."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"For some strange reason this film was either banned or never shown in the US until recently. A powerful yet bleak view of so called heroism during WWII. You could even leave the cinema with a doubt about who are in the right in any war when it comes to torture, abuse and murder. Gripping stuff."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Wonderfully complex take on the French resistance. All drama is quiet, and while there is suspense, a good bit of it is generated by moral dilemmas and the lengths to which ""heroes"" must go during wartime."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"The price of espionage troops.Ventura,Signoret,Meurisse,the all-star cast of Melville was ready to drum the front-line of A-class film-making,of which the remains of it some decades later are distant echoes,entangled subplots,why...I'll admit only Hitler was missing!"
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Not so much a war movie as a movie about ordinary people doing what they can do, even if it appears futile. The performances are all outstanding and the colour of this movie (or at least the exemplary Criterion Collection edition) is so beautiful it remains with you for days."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Un film crÃ©pusculaire qui donnent Ã  rÃ©flÃ©chir sur le vrai visage de la rÃ©sistance.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Melville's masterpiece. It is heartbreaking at times, ironic at times and darkly comedic at times. Melville is a master at mood."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Brilliant film! one of the darkest eras in history, done with grace and subtle humor. Obvious to see that many directors today have aspires to do what Melville achieved in this masterpiece."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Outstanding film. Superb. The cinematography is excellent and the mood is intense. See this.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"The French resistance in WWII are shown here in a very different way to any other depiction I have seen. The film is very bleak - the colours, the sound, the course of events. Absolutely brilliant."
1.0,army_of_shadows,one of the bleakest films i have ever seen. the cinematography and pacing of the film are so masterful!
1.0,army_of_shadows,"A parody on the tv series 'Allo, 'Allo."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"great film!I do not care for most war films, but this film I loved! meville's texture always gets my attention."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Melville's best non-crime film... then again, it's about underground resistance fighters in ww2 so it kind of is, and it has that dirty, cold feel that all Melville pictures have so well. It's really amazing, if long, and anyone interested in something from France on the subject should see it."
1.0,army_of_shadows,The best foreign language film I have ever seen after Das Boot. Masterpiece on all levels
1.0,army_of_shadows,A spy suspense thriller classic. Rich on not just entertainment level but also character development level. Intense and emotionally powerful.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Melville explores morality, rebellion and emotion amidst the Nazi occupation in France."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"One of the most challenging and beautiful films I have ever witnessed. Army of Shadows is a deep and complex study of Humanity in its darkest times, and all the greatness and horror that can come from it. Melville's masterful direction adds art and atmosphere to every frame."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"The struggles of the French in WWII, are finally given their due. Watch these cheese eating surrender monkeys deal with problems you could never imagine and make the decisions you aren't prepared to make. And such a pretty package too!"
1.0,army_of_shadows,Great resistance film. Best Melville film in my opinion.
1.0,army_of_shadows,None is fair in love and war.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Melville's best picture. It provides an emotional context for the rest of his work.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Un film impressionnante, comme tout chez Melville."
1.0,army_of_shadows,A film about the French Resistance that you will never forget.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Creative and amazing pacing, inspiring characters and inspired acting, strong and suspenseful story ... it's best war film I've ever seen and among the top films I've watched to date in years of moving watching. The antithesis of the American block buster."
1.0,army_of_shadows,insightful and humane look at the french resistance during WW2 - not miss!
1.0,army_of_shadows,Love this film. Reminded me so much of Munich that I can't help but think Spielberg ripped the look and feel of this movie off.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Absolutely brilliant. Puts his other films in a new perspective.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Simone Signoret at her best ...
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Incredible movie, dark and beautiful.A certain memory about the murder of the traitor."
1.0,army_of_shadows,The best and most thematic of Melville's movies. I'll never forget to run.
1.0,army_of_shadows,coldest tone of any movie I have seen... very bleak
1.0,army_of_shadows,The best movie I've seen in a theater. The darkness was so thick it was tangible. This movie will tear you apart with it's calculated pace and chilling exterior.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Dark, somber, tense."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"This chef d'oeuvre has been shot in 1969, damn it !!!"
1.0,army_of_shadows,I love a film that doesn't flinch and requires the same of its viewers. Brilliantly understated!
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Tremendous! Lino Ventura is a presence to be seen and seen again. Paul Meurisse and Simone Signoret together after ""Les Diaboliques"" is great! Melville's greatest film! Although just as great as ""Le Samourai"" or ""The Silence of the Sea."""
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Absolutely fantastic; utterly captivating. Great acting plus lots of tension and suspense. It's hard to believe this film didn't make it our for 37 years! It's long, but it doesn't feel like it -- I didn't want it to end."
1.0,army_of_shadows,After two days I'm still at a loss for words. All I can say is this: that was a friggin' journey.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Harrowing account of being in the French Resistance. Will resonate long after you've finished watching it, like years after you've finished watching it."
1.0,army_of_shadows,The problem with watching this movie is that you never get to watch it again for the first time.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Amazing! They sure don't make them like they used to. The film has been in the shadows for too long, this should be up there in the top 50 films of all time."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"It's unbelievably challenging to watch, but it's one of the most intense and powerful movies I've ever seen. I loved it."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Epoch and extraordinary.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Beautiful film about friendship, brotherhood, patriotism and sacrifice. Army of Shadows shows the struggle of the French Resistence during the Second World War."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"So good. The fact that this came out just two years ago is a shame. Easily the best Melville work and a contender for best French film of the sixties, Army of Shadows shows us the fallout from the war on France, and the devastating tolls it exacts from its citizens."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"A wonderful masterpiece presenting the early days of the French resistance. Melville's direction is flawless, weaving scenes of great atmosphere and tension. To think it was almost lost forever makes its restoration incredible."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"This film is pretty amazing. its a film about the french resistance, during the German takeover of France. it may move a bit slowly, but it is a great thriller."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Proabably top three best all around movies i've ever seen. Very influencial to both Francis Ford Coppola and Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. Gripping and suspenseful through and through.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Classic.Ventura is just perfect. Dark, intense and really sad."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"melville never ceases to amaze. i'm no expert on art/film about the resistance, but this has to be one of the best. ventura is amazing."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Absolutely amazing and effecting view of World War II. Fully recommended.
1.0,army_of_shadows,This is a striking and beautiful film. Flawless. The ending was perfect. Very impressive. It is one of my favorites.
1.0,army_of_shadows,this is one of the most flawless movies ever made. it has that cold mechanical brilliance that made melville's le samourai the most flawless movie i thought ever made before i saw this one.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"This is not a film about the war, this is about humanity."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Thankyou to Criterion for introducing me to this film. It totally blew me away. Melville creates a mood unlike any I've experienced.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Melville had his shit together. I still prefer Le Samorai.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Best. War Film. Ever.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Excellent, excellent film"
1.0,army_of_shadows,Melville was a cinematic genius.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"An amazing film. Subtle at times in the violence, but direct in others, you can feel the tension, desperation and dedication to the greater cause, even when their formal training and discipline (or lack thereof) leads to the hardest decisions."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Remarkable in every way. A must see+++++
1.0,army_of_shadows,"A wonderful movie that turns the duel between good and evil into a struggle for survival and were heroes are forced to behave like gangsters. The coldness of the actors and of the light gives the impression that each character carries death on his shoulder, others' and his."
1.0,army_of_shadows,A masterpiece! An absolute must!
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Another late 60s masterpiece by Melville, no less a ""cool"" existential tragedy than Le Samourai or Le Cercle Rouge."
1.0,army_of_shadows,The greatest French resistance film finally is released in the states.
1.0,army_of_shadows,C'est juste le meilleur film franÃ§ais de l'histoire du cinema ...
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Perhaps Melville's greatest. Made in 69, it ended up being hands-down the greatest film of 2006 (when it was finally shown on the big screen in the US). This is the sort of ""war"" film Spielberg's tiny brain cannot even dream of cooking up"
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Excellent and depressing film about those who fought in secret against insurmountable odds, never to see the fruit of their labors. Also includes a rare documentary on the bonus disc with the footage of the last days of combat between civilians and nazi troops on the streets of Paris."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"The criterion cover is much better than this poster, btw! The most magisterial, and fully developed of all of Melville's films, it is a beautiful and poignant film which not only witnesses to the particularities of the time it covers, but touches upon the perennially human."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Melville, bien sur, le seul Ã  pouvoir rÃ©aliser un film comme celui lÃ . Magistralement interprÃ©tÃ© par l'ensemble des acteurs."
1.0,army_of_shadows,It is all to telling that today in 2007 This film is more relevant ever.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Un film d'une rare intensitÃ©. Tout y est glacÃ©, comme la pÃ©riode durant laquelle l'action prend place. Sans doute une des oeuvres les plus impressionnantes sur la rÃ©sistance, sa violence comme mal nÃ©cessaire."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Top du top Melville.
1.0,army_of_shadows,every one MUST see this movie. It's awesome and so powerful
1.0,army_of_shadows,masterpiece. Signoret is unique
1.0,army_of_shadows,LE film sur la RÃ©sistance.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"The best film I've seen in the last year, this is a virtual masterpiece. The pace, the settings, and the acting are all superb."
1.0,army_of_shadows,This was the best film I saw all year.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Puisqu'il est question d'Ã©difier les lycÃ©ens... Peut-Ãªtre pourrait-on leur projeter cette oeuvre? Sans esbroufe.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Contains one of the best constructed scenes of intensity and desparation ever captured. Wholly engrossing.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Beautiful movie. Melville has done a wonderful job showing hope, when there is little or no hope to be found."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Days in the life of the French resistance. Uncompromising and unsentimental; Jean-Pierre Melville's finest film. Lino Ventura's face speaks louder about the dehumanizing force of war than just about anything else in all of cinema.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"The one thing I would change: iIwould put the opening scene back at the end of the movie, where it originally belonged. Other than that, I can't think of a flaw in it."
1.0,army_of_shadows,A French film not obsessed with fashion; who thought it possible?
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Wicked movie by a master of french cinema, Melville takes the french resistance and brings them to life in this harrowing tale of desperation during WW 2"
1.0,army_of_shadows,Incredibly rewarding.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Every frame of this movie deserves to be matted and hung on your wall, and the fact that you haven't done this makes you a worse person. The color, the shots, the mise en scene, the acting - this is marvelous."
1.0,army_of_shadows,This is probably my favorite movie ever. Jean-Pierre Melville is the master of this genre and gangster films and this is the truest film adaptation of the french resistance ever made.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Great melancholic and unsentimental - the resistance portrayed like sympathetic gangsters doing a difficul and terrible job.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Okay so it's basically the only film I've seen on the Resistance, but I don't doubt that it's one of the best as well."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Incredible French movie from the 70s set during WWII about the Resistance. Super-intense and gritty. Look-out for the parachute jump scene.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"A flick about the French Resistance, but in the style of a film noir. Not really much like a war movie, though... reminded me a lot of Brazil, or 1984... of brave, doomed heroes in their lonely struggle against hopeless odds."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Standing ovation. The Cahiers du Cinema had it all wrong, a rare mistake from the masters of the New Wave. Lino Ventura gives one of the greatest performances in film history. Too bad Melville wasn't around to see the reception the film has received in its 2006 North American release."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Ce que signifient patriotisme et sacrifice dans un pays dÃ©possÃ©dÃ© de son Ã¢me par l'occupation. Un chef d'oeuvre qui montre ce qu'il y avait derriÃ¨re le mot ""rÃ©sistance"", aujourd'hui bien galvaudÃ©e."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"The exact title for this part of french history, by one of his lead director and formal underground ""actor"" of this war..."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"One of my single favorite movies. Extra slick, super elegant (with often perfectly noticeable, low budget) cinematography that is as evocative as the storyline: frumpy, sweet dude is actually a resistance fighter and down-and-dirty killer. A meaty opus from the French cowboy Melville."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Yet another great Jean-Pierre Melville flick
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Ce film doit être vu , c'est tout..."
1.0,army_of_shadows,My favorite movie regarding WWII in Europe/occupied France. Almost unbearably tense at moments; definitely not for the sentimental.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Melville has become one of my favorite directors. I have only seen this and Le Samourai but there are no other movies like them. His style is so cool and perfect. I need to see more of his movies.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"This movie grabbed me and threw me into the French resistance along with the other characters. Leaving me feeling just as desperate and hopeless as the others, but still making me never stop to try and change it all and make a difference, even if it means dying for the cause."
1.0,army_of_shadows,It's hard to watch this film without gasping at the exquisite cinematography and top-notch acting.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Amazing and subtle. Exposing the true duality faced by people during wartime.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Absolutely incredible narrative that doesn't show you heroes in resisting the Nazis but explores the moral difficulty they often faced and asks if it was really worth it. The way the characters are presented simply and matter of factly makes this an absolute joy to watch.
1.0,army_of_shadows,The most perfect french resistance film ever.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Brilliant pacing. Brilliant acting. Look for color and use of camera as expression of message through technique. Melville does it all here. The depth of this political-thriller is one you'd seldom find in a genre often filled with little else beyond escapist aspirations and action/chase sequences.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"One of the best WWII films i've ever seen, incrediblely real and tragic."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"I really wish more directors could synthesize Melville (and Renoir)'s mix of realism and humanism. One of the great, great films of our time."
1.0,army_of_shadows,I'm really becoming a Meville fan. This movie has aged extremely well.
1.0,army_of_shadows,One of my favorite symbols: the Fallen Hat.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"A sad reflective film by Melville, dealing with the French resistance of Nazi Occupied France. Powerful and extremely moody. Has the dark somber feeling of his late films."
1.0,army_of_shadows,The French Resistance reimagined as a gangster movie!
1.0,army_of_shadows,Le plus grand film français de tous les temps.
1.0,army_of_shadows,definitely effective. melville adds his personal experiences to the movie and creates this emotionally effective masterpiece movie that nicely avoids the traps of cliches.
1.0,army_of_shadows,A highly emotive and beautiful film. Artfully capturing the fear and tension felt by the French Resistance during WWII. Brutal and highly effective.
1.0,army_of_shadows,A perfect film from 1969. Why is it being listed as a 2006 release just because the yanks were a bit slow off the blocks? Amateurs the lot of ye!
1.0,army_of_shadows,probably my favorite movie.
1.0,army_of_shadows,A true classic! Everything about it reeks of brilliance.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Wow... no words for this...
1.0,army_of_shadows,Best movie i have ever seen
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Bleak, extraordinary, masterful: inexplicable why it wasn't released here for forty years."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Stunning, magisterial cloak and dagger drama about the inner workings of the French Resistance during WWII. Fascinating and endlessly engrossing, this lost masterpiece by Jean-Pierre Melville is one for the ages."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"A masterpiece that focuses on the real heroes of WWII, the resistance leaders. A landmark in French Cinema that shoulda been released back in the 60's as opposed to 2006."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Wow, best French resistance movie ever. I cried at the end."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Best film of '06, made in '69.Now this masterpiece is finally released in the U.S."
1.0,army_of_shadows,great great film about the French Resistance.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Sans doute le meilleur film sur la resistance...
1.0,army_of_shadows,Melville's film is flawlessly executed. Slow deliberate pacing unveils a full bodied portrait of resistance against an insurmountable foe. The viewer will be moved and perturbed at the film's slightest suggestions.
1.0,army_of_shadows,So powerfull so strong so tough
1.0,army_of_shadows,Resistance fights as dressed-to-the-nines gangsters.. Melville at his best. A classic.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Simone Signoret puts the icing on a perfect cake.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Incredible portrat of the French Resistance. Maybe be Melville's best.""His confidence restrains me more than any shackles."""
1.0,army_of_shadows,The best movie of 2006! (but it just so happens to have been made 40 years ago). May give an indication of the progression cinema has made.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Bleak, tense and mind-blowing. Melville's best possibly?"
1.0,army_of_shadows,"The fact that 26% of people want to see this and 74% are not interested proves my theory that at least 3/4 of the population is dumb as rocks. You're the same people who voted for Bush a second time, aren't you? Terrorists."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Heartbreaking. Beautiful. Flawless.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"A movies about the French Resistance by a man who was a part of the French Resistance. There's an invaluable amount of style in this film, also it's obviously very personal, so it's one of the best movies you'll ever watch."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Sad to think it took about 40 something years for this thing to finally come out over here. It's one of the best movies you can ever see.
1.0,army_of_shadows,What an exquisite film. Such implosive performances by Lino Ventura and Simone Signoret. A truly inspiring film of such beautful sadness.
1.0,army_of_shadows,This movie rocked me.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Simply amazing. One of the most suspenseful movies I've ever seen but it's intensity comes from the smallest things like leaving a train knowing that if security searches you, you are literally a dead man. This is a movie that I will spend the rest of my life harassing my friends to see."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Melville at his best.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Best film of 2006? So so... so haunting....
1.0,army_of_shadows,I think a critic just summed it up best. He siad it was a great film but also one of the most upsetting films I know.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"A haunting, complex work from master director Melville. This film is dark, and certainly not for those who need some happiness in their movies. Brilliant throughout, and expertly made."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Smart as hell. All about the personal and public costs of devoting ones self to espionage and one's country. It shows how in many ways, members of the French Resistance lost their lives before they actually died."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"This movie is SOOO good but SOO sad. It's incredibly done. It has nothing like 'a hollywood ending"" (cuz its a French movie, and is in French...)"

1.0,army_of_shadows,Best movie I've seen in a while. Maybe Melville's best.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Probably the best movie I've ever seen in a theater. Besids the general cinematic brilliance, it manages to empathize with the characters while NOT heroizing them. If anything the film shows that, in war, everyone is a villain."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Absolutely brilliant.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Easily within my top five. Bleak, unflinching."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Brilliant on every level.
1.0,army_of_shadows,The machine gun execution is one of the tensest moments evere captured on film.

1.0,citizen_kane,I kept thinking of Rupert Murdoch throughout this film.
1.0,citizen_kane,"The best cinematography I have ever seen, a simple moral, great acting and amazing writing. Majority of the films I see today have styles that Mr. Welles used in this masterpiece, and an ending that boggles that mind. This is truly the greatest and most influential film of all time"
1.0,citizen_kane,"Most people know that this is one of the greatest movies ever. Well, it is. Introduced all kinds of original directing techniques and ways to tell a story. Its as original today as it was then, a must see."

1.0,the_wrestler,"Touching, emotional, excellent actings, Mickey Rourke Rocks! Amazing history, fantastic even simple!"
1.0,the_wrestler,"Rourke is forceful and aches with emotion; Aronofsky may create the seedy world that feels real and true but the lead performance transcends it, bringing new meaning to acting itself."
1.0,the_wrestler,"this defines a classic movie, raw, dirty....greatness."
1.0,the_wrestler,Mickey Rorke's finest performance! He should be an Oscar contender for this stellar portrayal of a most unusual character. Every performance is spot on and the dialigue and story line do not disappoint. This is a must see for drama lovers and Mickey Rourke lovers as well.
1.0,the_wrestler,Mickey Rourke gives one of the best performances I've seen in a long time in this movie about an aged wrestler struggling with life and still trying to have a wrestling career long after his prime is over.

1.0,the_wrestler,One of the best character dramas of the last decade. I was totally absorbed into the lives of these characters. Rourke and Tomei are in top form in a movie that has the feel of something we'd have seen in the early 70's.

1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,Elia Kazan's classic adaptation of the stage piece is witty and heartbreaking - while Marlon Brando's and Vivien Leigh's stellar performances redefined screen acting.

1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,"STELLAr performance from Marlon Brando playing a psychotic alpha-male. I've only seen the director's cut of this movie, which is just a few minutes longer, so I can only imagine what a disservice the censors did to 1951 audiences by forcing Kazan to release a sanitized version of this film."
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,Hahaha. No consensus yet on Streetcar? Let's go ahead and agree on one. It's one of the best movies of all-time. Brilliantly written. Brilliantly directed. Brilliantly acted. It is the beginning of Brando's takeover of Hollywood as the best film actor of all-time.

1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,If I were ever to be a drag queen Viven Leigh's performance as Blanche Dubois would be my inspiration.

1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,"A movie that constantly challenged the norms and the censors. It changed cinema forever. Raunchy, dramatic and powerful, this film is a classic within its own category. Marlon Brando became a star because of this film and the play it was based on."

1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,Arguably the greatest display of ensemble acting ever to grace the screen. Brando makes a brilliant debut. Karl Malden and Kim Hunter turn out amazing performances but the movie truly belongs to Vivein Leigh. Her heart-breaking performance still moves me.
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,"The delicate, fragile, southern woman Blanche, the arrogant and violent Stanley, conflicts between two different lives, stunning performance by Vivien Leigh and Brando, with some controversial footage having been deleted, all make this a masterpiece."

1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,My favorite movie of all time!
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,Should have won an Oscar. Stunning film.
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,"If it weren't for Vivian Leigh's tormented and insecure nature along with Marlon Brando's macho, manly bravado, this movie would be quite boring."
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,"Top-notch, superlative American classic released at the exact right time. Kazan's melody dedicated to aristocratic tendencies and male despotism is a really solid diamond worth holding the rest of our decades.  99/100"

1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,The best all time Brando classic that made him a star taken fro the Tennessee Williams play that also stared Brando.
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,"Straight? What's 'straight'? A line can be straight, or a street. But the heart of a human being?"
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,"Wonderful adaptation. Tennessee Williams was always disappointed that Brando's charisma made this story about Stanley rather than Blanche, as he intended, but it's a magnificent story with powerhouse performances by everyone involved."
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,LOVE IT! B&W; at its finest! I know every line to this movie and Brando is so hot in this!
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,"Wonderful, just wonderful."
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,"A dramatic history, but ultimately I found the conflict between the characters to be very compelling, and withoit forget the exellent performance of Marlon Brando and the subtle picture of grace at the very end was powerful and make this a exellent movie."
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,"well what can be said here,my oldest daughter watched this in high school for drama class and came home telling me how sexy Brando was up untill that she had only seen him in the godfather and I was like yep pretty nice to loook at he was!!"

1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,"Watch three excellent actors respectively brooding (Brando), longing (Hunter) and fruitlooping (the wonderful Leigh) their way through a heartbreaker of a film. It looks much better than a play adaptation should too."
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,Kazan's opus and possibly Brando's greatest performance.
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,aaaaah! one of my faves.

1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,Tense and stylish film adaptation of the classic play. Brando and Vivien Leigh shine.
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,Marlon the perfect Kowalski ...
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,I am a huge fan of Tennessee Williams and Streetcar is my favorite play. The movie does the play justice and the cast is absolutely terrific!

1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,this is when marlon brando looked good!! lol
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,Bloody brilliant! Vivien Leigh pulled one of the best performances I have ever seen by an actress. This must surely be the Hamlet of female roles. Terrific performances by all the actors and top notch script. A must-see and a true classic.
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,STELLA!!! Enough Said!
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,Really good. I think it is Marlon Brando's best movie. Sorry Godfather fans. Should I say more. Oh wait STELLA!!!!

1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,Excellent film with interesting characters.
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,Probably the best play-to-film adaptation ever.
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,"Who's not be smitten by the movie w Marlon Brando and Vivien Leigh on it and directed by Elia Kazan, one of my top 20 films of all time"
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,"leigh won her second oscar for her refined, yet feral performance as blanche. it seems that no matter who plays blanche, a little vivien leigh goes with them."
0.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,"spoiler alert: the chick is nuts, don't waste your time with this movie. reminds me so much of gone with the wind. drawn out and somewhat of a downer"
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,"Still the definitive screen version of Tennesee William's controversial play. Marlon Brando, Vivien Leigh, Karl Malden and Kim Hunter give a two hour class on what great acting is all about."
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,A must see for any movie lover!
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,Brando in his clasic era. The classic smouldering cauldron of emotions just waiting to erupt. Pure theatre at its best.
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,"Marlon Brando and Vivien Leigh make magic in this stunning story of family bonds and true love. Simply put, it is a beautiful film adaption and a must-see classic. Really a true masterpiece."
0.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,"I, quite frankly, hated the play. This is the one time that I wish hollywood had changed the storyline."

1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,"""stella! stella! stella!!!"""
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,Che meraviglia!E Vivien Leigh semplicemente stupenda!
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,brando is great. vivien leigh was.. different.. obviously classically trained.. she wasn't bad.. just different. but yeah. brando is pretty amazing. he is simply the best. even though it's cliche. he is.
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,almost better than the play...
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,This was one of my favorite old movies!! I thought Marlon Brando looked really cool!!
1.0,the_conformist,"my best movie all time. Director, scenario, actors, photography, all fantastic. unforgettable"
1.0,the_conformist,A movie that makes me remember why cinema is art.
1.0,the_conformist,"The Conformist is one of the most beautiful visions of life ever recorded on film, displaying Italy's architecture as monuments surrounded by tableau."
1.0,the_conformist,The ending. The very last scene in the movie. That look he gives without saying anything at all says everything about his character outline throughout the entire movie. I'm blown away.
1.0,the_conformist,"The Conformist is commendable for its lavish production and masterful photography, certainly, but where the brilliance lies is in its portrayal of a man who is in a constant struggle with not only his political affiliations, but with his marriage, his sexuality, and his life."
1.0,the_conformist,"Exquisite, poignant, and extremely alluring."
1.0,the_conformist,"Another take on the banality of evil, through the cowardice and desire for conformity even though he is aware things outside of such conformity. An entirely visual rumination on life, but difficult if to follow narratively."
1.0,the_conformist,The title says it all.
1.0,the_conformist,??...????????????...???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
1.0,the_conformist,A must see film. Bertolucci is completely at ease and this is where it all starts.
1.0,the_conformist,"'Animula vagula blandula Hospes comesque corporis' (Little soul of mine, tender and soft, sweet companion of my body). Capturing Rene Magritte's surreal paintings, this film about identity portrays an unforgettable cinematic and dynamic style of beauty."
1.0,the_conformist,"One of my favourite films - a perfect cast, great cinematography, fantastic use of colour and space. Hard to beat."
1.0,the_conformist,"Far less deep than it appears to be, The Conformist is sustained by the beauty of its compositions and the elegance of its camerawork, which capture the false grandeur of fascist Italy and one man's attempt to evade its evil in order to live a ""normal"" life."
1.0,the_conformist,"Dialogues, performances, cinematography, soundtrack: everything works perfectly and creates a tense atmosphere that helps the film to become one of Bertolucci's great masterpieces."
1.0,the_conformist,the best photographed film I have ever seen.
1.0,the_conformist,"The Conformist is clever and intelligent, sporadic and entertaining, featuring a wide array of visuals that spark artsy inspiration and a fascist centerpiece that ignites political commentary."
1.0,the_conformist,"Brilliant cinematography,clever shot-taking n a delightful conception....one of the best endings which signifies dual meanings..one of them really takes the film to a gr8r level..1 gr8 visually stunning movie...Bertoluccis best till date"
1.0,the_conformist,Bernardo Bertolucci. Vittorio Storaro. Nedo Azzini. And. Jean-Louis Trintignant
1.0,the_conformist,An indisputable contender for the most beautiful film ever shot.
1.0,the_conformist,Un'opera d'arte dal genio Bertolucci!
1.0,the_conformist,The more I view this film the more I recognize it's brilliance.
1.0,the_conformist,"A very cold character study that is impossible to shake, once viewed. Stunning and seminal photography by the great Vittorio Storaro."
1.0,the_conformist,So contemporary so beautiful.
1.0,the_conformist,"Simplesmente uma obra prima. Meio que uma mistura de noir com arthouse.. Puta que me pariu, visualmente lindo , atuaÃ§Ãµes perfeitas (destaque pra Dominique Sanda que alem de atuar bem, pqp que mulher..) de primeira pode atÃ (C) parecer um pouco confuso, mas nada de mais.. recomendadÃ­ssimo."
1.0,the_conformist,"Gorgeous, possibly the best-looking movie ever made. Also some jaw-dropping direction and acting, and a huge story which is ultimately a bit too sprawling. But a must-see movie for anyone who loves movies."
1.0,the_conformist,"I could wach this movie without any sound, as it is such a great exercise in style. Bertolucci's masterpiece as far as I am concerned, and a sad reminder that the guy hasn't made anything approaching this level since the mid-70s. Resting on your laurels there, Bernardo?"
1.0,the_conformist,"so beautifully made,is wonderful and a great classic"
1.0,the_conformist,Visual storytelling at its best.
1.0,the_conformist,"If you love great film, this will leave you jaw dropped and blown away."

1.0,the_conformist,Yet another masterpiece from the great Bertolucci.
1.0,the_conformist,"Bertolucci's best film, il conformista, is a true masterpiece...Visually stunning and emotionally powerful, il conformista touches the greatness of the ancient tragedies and the power of classic operas..."
1.0,the_conformist,"As drama it just about works, but this is elevated into the ranks of greatness by the breathtaking cinematography. Every frame is a poem: the use of light, colour, shadow, shading, smoke, mirrors! Absolutely incomparable."
1.0,the_conformist,"One of the greatest movies ever. Has such a powerful theme of having to conform to ones society, obviously if you look at the title. Amazing cinematography, acting, directing and writing. This really struck a chord in me after watching it. Also one of the best endings ever."
1.0,the_conformist,A fantastic film about Italian fascism and beautifully shot as well.
1.0,the_conformist,"If the ideas don't touch the imagination, the film's sensuous texture does. It's a triumph of feeling and of style - lyrical, flowing, velvety style, so operatic that you come away with sequences in your head like arias"
1.0,the_conformist,"Probably my favorite film of all time. Best cinematography of all time, best art direction, one of the best scripts... just too much good stuff to say on here without feeling like I forgot something, so just see it for yourself."
1.0,the_conformist,"Classy, beautiful, and intriguing. A masterpiece in so many levels!"
1.0,the_conformist,"one of the early Bertolucci masterpieces- immaculate cinematography, and a theme that has been theoretically analyzed SO much by academia that is reason enough not to mention more about it here. absolute classic and a must-watch-it for any serious film buff."
1.0,the_conformist,Italian Cinema at its best
1.0,the_conformist,"THe film that annced a new master of cinema in the form of Bernardo Bertolucci... Before the REvolution was fine, 'Partner' was weird, but htis is the real McCoy. Stylistically brilliant, chic, immaculately acted and entirely memorable."
1.0,the_conformist,A masterpiece - Bertolucci's film addresses issues of self-betrayal and repression in a movie way ahead of it's time. The beauty of the film remains intact after nearly forty years.
1.0,the_conformist,"A terrifying picture of a person who commits atrocities by allowing others around him to take the actions. The acting is brilliant. Not only is Dominique Sanda unutterably beautiful, but there is a scene where she gives one of the most powerfully horrifying performances I have ever seen on screen."
1.0,the_conformist,IL MEGLIO DEL MEGLIO DEL CINEMA ITALIANO
1.0,the_conformist,Autobiography of a nation.
1.0,the_conformist,"I've got next to no fucking clue what happened in it, but hot damn, was it beautiful."
1.0,the_conformist,"the cinematography in il conformista is some of the most inspiring lighting and composition i've ever seen in a film. although the plot is hard to follow, due to structure and pacing, it is still a fascinating way to tell a story."
1.0,the_conformist,"shakes your insides. a beautiful capture of relationship, violence, weak vs strong, person vs fascism, beautiful scenes and...I love 70'ies."
1.0,the_conformist,"supremoper tecnica, estetica e vicendasplendido trintignant e seducente Dominique Sandail film più attuale di bertoluccie probabilmente il più riuscitosenza parole."
1.0,the_conformist,"Fantastic. A hypnotizing look at Fascism and conformity. The only reason not to see this film is if you happen to be illiterate and are unable to read subtitles, otherwise this is not to be missed."
1.0,the_conformist,"A perfect existentialist film with a double-edged finale, enveloped in Plato's fable of the Cave. It builds slowly and steadily to the most devastating final fifteen minutes of a film anyone is likely to see - if you like novels like The Pigeon and The Tenant, see this at once."
1.0,the_conformist,Sick film. Great cinematography. Top notch acting. I love it. The assassination scene in the forest is one of the most brutal scenes you're ever likely to see. The two main actresses are super hot. This is never a bad thing.
1.0,the_conformist,"There is no doubting. This is an incredible film. The editing, performances, mise-en-scene, music -- particularly the way the framing isolates the conformist against the colour, movement and lighting of other objects."
1.0,the_conformist,bertollucci has done an unlinear story-telling from 1970!! what a great movie...
1.0,the_conformist,"Well-observed relationships, gorgeous photography. I'd like to see this again and again."
1.0,the_conformist,"A beautiful film, the most stylish of all. Bertolucci's drama focuses on intrigue, sex, and politics. Trintignant is a european Bogart."
1.0,the_conformist,Bertolucci's absolute masterpiece....
1.0,the_conformist,one of the most amazing pieces of art i've seen.
1.0,the_conformist,"The possible influence of Foucault in examining what normalcy is, might be, should be, could be makes for a great character study."
1.0,the_conformist,I doubt it is still possible to make a film like that...
1.0,the_conformist,I saw this about thirty times when I was 20. It has all kinds of subtexts that subvert the original storyline from the novel as well as the overt intentions of the director. Drenchingly beautiful with one of the finest movie scores ever.
1.0,the_conformist,"My favorite scene is Marcello Clerici's visit to his father in classical Roman bedlam. No, it's Giulia's dance in the apartment."
1.0,the_conformist,"Brilliant! Probably Bertolucci's best. We are taken into the heart of a shallow man. Should be inane, but it's gripping. Trintignant is riveting. The photography is magnificent. Master film making."
1.0,the_conformist,"the best foreign language film ever made. beautiful cinematography, classic use of light from the masters Bertolluci & Vittorio Storaro"
1.0,the_conformist,"LOOOOVED IT. Stylishly filmed, beautifully put together, all the characters are fantasticly written, it might even jump to a ***** after a rewatch. -Done ;)- Just see it."
1.0,the_conformist,The greatest cinematography of all time boosts a great film into the pantheon of the greatest films. Bertolucci created a great film that had a huge influence on The Godfather.
1.0,the_conformist,"Between Scarfiotti's art design, Delerue's period score, Storaro's lenses and Bertolucci's emerging operatic style, AND the beauty of Dominique Sanda and a young Trignitant juxtaposed against the spineless cruelty of fascist minds, it does not get better than this film classic."
1.0,the_conformist,[i]Review coming soon.[/i]
1.0,the_conformist,A heavy influence on The Godfather. Visually stunning with a great story.
1.0,the_conformist,The mind's eye boggles
1.0,the_conformist,"Beautiful film about a sheep in wolves clothing. It occasionally overstretches itself in the style department and the metaphor with Plato's cave is pretentious, but is thought-provoking and brave in depicting the choices made in the rarely discussed (internally, anyway) fascist-era Italy."
1.0,the_conformist,"this movie is a combination of: some of the best use of light and shadow ever seen on film and an enormously engrossing story with extremely compelling characters. In other words, it is one of cinema's best."
1.0,the_conformist,Bertolucci's dispaly of his talent before he got lost in political explorations and artistic falsehoods.

1.0,the_conformist,"Haha, What can I say that hasn't been said already? Just go see it! I might have to watch it again because I was so amazed by the visuals that I barely paid attention to the story."
1.0,the_conformist,"Fantastic cinematography, very slow paced although I didn't see this as a downer I can see it puting a lot of people off."
1.0,the_conformist,Stunningly cinematography and elegantly structured nonlinear plotting makes Bertolucci's study of sex and politics a must see. This is film at it's classiest.
1.0,the_conformist,"In college, this movie, along with Faulkner, ended my alleged med school career as I realized that art was far more interesting."
1.0,the_conformist,Brilliant beautiful movie that must be seen in a movie theater to be fully appreciated.
1.0,the_conformist,"Visually stunning. It's rare when I finish a movie and want to immediately start it up again. Call it a short attention span or a continuing thirst for new stimulation, but either way, I needed to back and rewatch some."
1.0,the_conformist,Exceptional. Storaros photography is magnificent.
1.0,the_conformist,"bravo bertolucci, and with out Brando or naked French teenagers (disappointedly of course), bravo."
1.0,the_conformist,"i've never seen anything quite like this film. The marriage of story, camera, character and theme make it overpowering every time i watch it. So many virtually perfect scenes...the chase music...the swirling leaves...train sex...black/white, confession, the asylum..."

1.0,the_conformist,Un des films importants de ma vie. Une adaptation d'un roman de Moravia avec en toile de fond l'Allegorie de la caverne de Platon et en prime la tres charmante Dominique Sanda. Je voulais faire ma maitrise en litterature sur Bertolluci... J'y ai decouvert Platon et Georges Leroux.
1.0,the_conformist,Stunningly enchanting cinematography with so many layers in the story line that you can watch again and read new meaning
1.0,the_conformist,"The ""anti-realism"" of Bertolucci + Alberto Moravia's novel on Fascism and sexual repression = beautiful."

1.0,the_conformist,This movie is beautifully shot and executed. Can't believe it was made in 1970.
1.0,the_conformist,"bizarrely, if you've ever seen it, the movie I based my first student film on. Thank god Criterion released it on DVD - now I can toss my awful DVD dubs of crappy VHS dubs of a long unavailable laserdisc edition... Maybe the best film Bertolucci ever made"
1.0,the_conformist,Fantastic cinematography.
1.0,the_conformist,A sumptuous film that not enough people know about. Its credit is much overdue.

1.0,the_conformist,Bertolucci at his best!
0.0,the_conformist,bad movie. Highly overrated.
1.0,the_conformist,This is worth watching for Vittorio Storaro's outstanding cinematography alone but this is also a highly intriguing character study of a man (Jean-Louis Trintignant) who is a Fascist agent under the Mussolini regime. This is Bertolucci at his very best.
1.0,the_conformist,A masterpiece of drama/eros/noir/politics and entertaining regardless of whatever language you watch it in (but you'd better not watch it dubbed!!) Pre 'Godfather' genious
1.0,the_conformist,"Light, colour, beauty and moral decay."

1.0,the_conformist,"Absoluely beautiful in every single way. Dramatically complex, visually stunning - it puts a total spell on you."
1.0,the_conformist,"Probably one of the most beautifully shot films I've ever seen. The use of angles, light and color is among the best I've ever seen. Not to say the plot itself is slouching, as it's a great and horrifying story of what a man will do to be accepted by society."
1.0,the_conformist,"Beautiful film. Long tracking shots, sparse dialogue. Storraro is the real star of the film."
1.0,the_conformist,"Visually brilliant, this is THE filmmaker's film. The camera seems to be a character just as much as the actors, which makes it all the more entralling..."
1.0,the_conformist,Overwhelmingly beautiful. Haunting. Tragic.
1.0,the_conformist,One of the best films ever made. Seriously.

1.0,the_conformist,a beautiful amazingly haunting film who's poignancy and meaning still retains especially in our current world
1.0,the_conformist,Storaro at his best. One of my all time favorite films.
1.0,the_conformist,"Possibly the top 3 best movies ever seen in my life. The meaningful lighitng palette, the imaginative use of tilts and trackings, and more importantly, the arrangement of subjects within the frame, in other words, arbitrary composition"
1.0,the_conformist,A film which highlights the connections between conformity and fascism. A later sequel showed the connections between the Fashion Industry and conformity. The final part of the trilogy (called Fashionism) wraps everything up neatly. Watch this film.

1.0,the_conformist,Stunning direction and camera work along with excellent performances and a truly fascinating plot make this an excellent movie that can't be missed by film buffs or Bertolucci fans.
1.0,the_conformist,I don't why you would call yourself a cinematographer or a director if you didn't make an effort to watch this flick. Storaro and Bertolucci collaborating. This film really influenced me the most visually.
1.0,the_conformist,bertolucci's greatest film and like vigo he was only 29
1.0,the_conformist,"This is a masterpiece of 1970's european cinema, made when Bertolucci was still only 30. I think it is his greatest film, shot on the border crossing between dream and nightmare."

1.0,tokyo_story,A very simple yet beautiful film!!
1.0,tokyo_story,"Ozu takes a page out of De Sica's book, a story so simple and yet incredibly powerful, and poignant. It's one of those films that tries to make you cry but doesn't make it obvious, and is very subtle. One of the best Japanese films ever made."

0.0,tokyo_story,"What a piece of crap. The cinematography was absolutely disgusting. It's quite possibly the ugliest movie I've ever seen. None of the characters were interesting or sympathetic, they just sat around with retarded looks on their faces. And there was no emotion or atmosphere in the entire movie."
1.0,tokyo_story,Bought this movie in college when I started getting into Japanese Cinema thanks to a World Cinema course I was taking. Tokyo Story is a simple story done perfectly.
1.0,tokyo_story,Expertly and delicately crafted. Characters will remain unforgettable.
1.0,tokyo_story,A great movie.No matter how much is said it will still be less to such a great movie.Seldom such a movie comes.Long live asian cinema
1.0,tokyo_story,The movie deals with the way an elderly couple is treated by their children and grand children treats. The movie questions the subtle things in relationships where the children amidst their busy life forget the parents. The parents soon become an object of nuisance. A must watch movie

1.0,tokyo_story,"""Isn't life disappointing?""

1.0,tokyo_story,Voyage Ã  tokyo de Ozu est un monument de l'histoire du cinÃ©ma. C'est l'histoire d'un couple qui va voir ses enfants trÃ¨s occupÃ©s Ã  Tokyo. Un film touchant sur les liens familiaux qui se distandent. TrÃ©s grand classique.
1.0,tokyo_story,"Yasujiro Ozu shows that a beautiful and powerfully emotional story can be told using only stationary camera shots, without losing any of it's effect. Brilliant."
1.0,tokyo_story,One of my most treasured films. Perfection.
1.0,tokyo_story,Yasujiro Ozu's most famous film is a masterpiece in mood and pace. The film is also infinitely successful in managing to tackle life affecting issues in such an understated and selfless way.
1.0,tokyo_story,A gentle and exquisite masterwork that is instructive about the constant changes in life and family relations and the resulting ambivalence that arises from it. Not surprised that it's considered to be essential viewing for any film lover.

1.0,tokyo_story,One of the best dramas of all times.All current drama directors should take note.Aspiring filmmakers should also take notes on how to effectively use stationary camera.

1.0,tokyo_story,"""Isn't life disappointing?"""

1.0,tokyo_story,"Yasujiro Ozu's astounding parable on family is a gorgeous and gentle masterpiece. It's a world-beloved movie (with good reason) and a prime example of the life-changing power of cinema. As one critic put it, ""Like people-watching from the point of view of a god."""
1.0,tokyo_story,A towering cinematic achievement full of life-affirming humanism.
1.0,tokyo_story,My favorite Ozu. One of the saddest story told on film.
1.0,tokyo_story,Beautiful. Ozu's best.
1.0,tokyo_story,"Tokyo Monogatari was a masterpiece narration. Ozu was one of the Japanese greatest film director. Unlike Akira Kurosawa who always portray the tragedy in an epic tale, Ozu prefer to crafting the poetic side of human life. Tokyo Story was superb."
1.0,tokyo_story,"Ozu's very best film, and not just because everyone says it is. It's just a sublimely photographed, written and observed family drama. The debate about whether Ozu is slow has gone on for decades - I guess some people have trouble getting into his style, but I loved this."
1.0,tokyo_story,This is the film that started my interest in Japanese cinema. A masterpiece.
1.0,tokyo_story,simplicity made film.
1.0,tokyo_story,"This film sneaks up on you. What appears to be a basic family drama slowly shades in each character until the finale, which packs such an emotional wallop that you'll feel dazed & confused for days afterwards. By far the best film about family dynamics I've ever seen."
1.0,tokyo_story,I want to cry just thinking about it.
1.0,tokyo_story,It's just an amazing movie.
1.0,tokyo_story,"Other than maybe Hou Hsiao-hsien, no one really has the courage and talent to make movies like this. I'm embarrassed by every scene or story I've ever imagined. Movie makers should be ashamed of themselves."
1.0,tokyo_story,The film that started my Ozu obsession. Classic.
1.0,tokyo_story,"Pretty depressing old school Japanese flick about kids living their lives and abandoning their parents. However, it's beautiful, sad, and absolutely wonderful. Ozu has such a unique eye and each shot is stunning."
1.0,tokyo_story,A morality play of family members representing a spectrum of filial devotion - I was amazed how I could feel and hear myself in all the characters portrayed.
1.0,tokyo_story,Ozu's comtemplative study of familial detachment is poignant and acheingly beautiful in it's simplicity and emotional resonance.
1.0,tokyo_story,amazing capture of human relationship
1.0,tokyo_story,One of Ozu's best and probably the most accsible to Western viewers. Elderly couple visit their children in Tokyo and end up being passed around by the children who don't have the time or money to waste on them. Typical Ozu formula of the disintegration of the pre-war traditional Japanese lifestyle.
1.0,tokyo_story,Ovviamente Ã¨ del 53 e non del 72. La piÃ¹ grande opera d'arte su pellicola di sempre.
1.0,tokyo_story,DEspite the little woman sittingi next to me who was crying the whole movie I think this movie is excellent. Family relationships shown in simple way leaves you thinking about the complexity of values and family in today's societies.
1.0,tokyo_story,Probably my favorite movie... Subtle acting that brings out the core intricacies of human relationships.
1.0,tokyo_story,Very touching story done by great Mr.Ozu

1.0,tokyo_story,Planted a seed of gloom in my heart recently.
1.0,tokyo_story,One of the best portrayals of intimacy and distance and all the complexities in between human relationships within the context of the family between two and three generations. Profoundly moving through it simplicity. One of the greatest films ever made.
1.0,tokyo_story,"The original of ""Lost in translation"" at Tokyo, but also in family and in generation gap. Hara Setsuko is divinely beautiful..."
1.0,tokyo_story,"yes,subtle, touching, brilliant."
1.0,tokyo_story,One of the three best movies I've ever seen.
1.0,tokyo_story,"Un chef d'oeuvre, un classique, parfait pour dÃ©couvrir Ozu."
1.0,tokyo_story,This is in my top 3. It's got a subtle tone and a unique shooting style that fits the story line.
1.0,tokyo_story,Tokyo Story (and everything Ozu did) makes me feel naive... a simple story which cuts close to the hidden substance of human integrity and does more to convey the effects of circumstance in our lives than any other film i've seen - to the extent where i can't understand most of what it has to say!
1.0,tokyo_story,A slow moving movie that creeps up on you at the end. A sad story about apathy and loss of character and the difficulty of trying to survive as an empathetic person in an neglecting world.
1.0,tokyo_story,A Masterpiece. A movie which changes your life.
1.0,tokyo_story,One of the best movies ever made.

1.0,tokyo_story,"Any film by Ozu suits me, in fact I have four volumes of his dvd's, but this is the one that introduced me to the work of this remarkable director, and remains a firm favourite. His perceptions of human frailties and foibles are universal and absolutely spot on."
1.0,tokyo_story,"A masterpiece. The sadness and meaningless of human life and pettyness of human nature, told in an intimate and simplistic way, stylistically perfect. But why does this stupid Flixter say it's from 1972? It's from 1953."

1.0,tokyo_story,cinematographic excellence

1.0,tokyo_story,Absolutely amazing. Is that the U.S. release date? It was made in the 50s.
1.0,tokyo_story,"A direct but effective directorial style pervades this classic film. The variety of characters are magnificently real, and Ozo coaxes entire lifetimes out of their expressions. Subtle, touching, brilliant."

1.0,tokyo_story,Masterpiece dramatic movie. Ozu is the best. I always preferd his movies more than Korozawa's ones.
1.0,tokyo_story,"This is a ploddingly slow movie that would never make it on today's fast-paced world--but then again, that's exactly the point of the movie, isn't it? This is a beautiful, moving and painful movie about change, selfishness, life in the fast lane, and the generation gap."
1.0,tokyo_story,"A wonderful family drama, remains entirely relevant to familial relationships in any time or society, deeply affecting, couldn't recommend it highly enough..."
1.0,tokyo_story,An exquisitely rendered film that explores timeless themes of relationships between the generations and the passing of time.

1.0,tokyo_story,Wonderful film! A film that EVERYONE should go to see!
1.0,tokyo_story,"Justin Plummer,Perhaps you shouldn't be watching films of this caliber. You might hurt yourself. Not everyone lives in America, not everyone talks like you, and life isn't full of cuts. Your critique makes no sense. Don't be so ignorant of other cultures, moron."
1.0,tokyo_story,"Ozu's still camera quietly shows us the lives of a Japanese family. The subtleness of the story is reflective of the lives of most normal people, where many find themselves saying quite nonchalantly, ""Yes, life is disappointing."""
1.0,tokyo_story,yes i took film studies.
1.0,tokyo_story,The year should read 1953. An utterly shattering experience. Could be the finest film ever made.

1.0,tokyo_story,Just simply the most honest film i have ever seen. Bootiful
1.0,tokyo_story,"Breathtaking cinema. Profoundly touching, deeply personal, and universally-in-the-now. It ranks up there with ""The Bicycle Thief"" as one of the best in transcendental / neo-realism cinema. I loved it."
1.0,tokyo_story,"The essence of Ozu contained. I teared up at least nine or ten times this viewing, two of which were actual crying. The conclusion is one of the most devastatingly insightful lines of any film. Ever."
1.0,tokyo_story,"Besides Akira Kurosawa, Yasujiro Ozu is Japan's greatest contribution to film, and here's his signature masterwork. This quietly haunting film will leave you wanting so much more, it's one of the 100 best films ever."
1.0,tokyo_story,"Probably the most powerful film I've ever seen. It's the things that aren't said that matter. Ozu, a true genius"
1.0,tokyo_story,Ozu's finest exploration of the human condition. One of the greatest films ever made. Period.
1.0,tokyo_story,Why does this flixter say this movie was made in 72? Didn't Ozu die in the 60's?
0.0,tokyo_story,"I can see how many argue that it ""captures real life"" with its long takes and bland dialogue, but that is no excuse for it being completely uninteresting."
1.0,tokyo_story,"The first Ozu film I've seen, which I guarantee won't be my last. Powerfully quiet and cathartic."
1.0,tokyo_story,"Quiet, still, deliberate - gorgeous."
1.0,tokyo_story,"One of the most beautiful films ever made. If you can relax into it's meandering pace, you come to know the characters with a delicate intimacy that is rare in our fast-paced media diet."
1.0,tokyo_story,All I have to say is this movie was beautifully directed.
1.0,tokyo_story,"A slow moving, but very delicate family drama. Ozu takes his time developing every character to the fullest extent, and it pays off with a very emotional final act. A beautiful, realistic film."
1.0,tokyo_story,The greatest movie ever made about the 20th Century.
1.0,tokyo_story,"It's pretty much one of the great films of history. Yes nothing happens, but it still manages to reduce you to tears by the end. Very Japanese, and very much a movie person's movie."
1.0,tokyo_story,A poetic masterpeice. Ozu films always seem to be able to take a seemly mundane story and make it incredibly deep and though provoking. Another masterpiece by easily one of the best filmmakers to ever live
1.0,tokyo_story,"One of the best and most deeply moving films I've ever seen. Ozu is a master at directing to achieve the perfect emotions and tone for this subdued, patient story of love, loss, and family. Probably as poignant and relevant today as it was during its release."
1.0,tokyo_story,"Ozu kan sakene sine. Ikke mye mer Ã¥ si, egentlig ..."
1.0,tokyo_story,"Yasujiro Ozu, where have you been all my life?"
1.0,tokyo_story,Ozu at his heartbreaking best.
0.0,tokyo_story,This is the most boring thing ever filmed.
1.0,tokyo_story,"It's 53, not 72. Ozu's camera never moves, always still. The movie's ending is quietly devastating. A masterpiece for the patient."
1.0,tokyo_story,"A beautiful, heartbreaking and mesmerizing masterpiece. No other film that I have seen has better captured the essence of an elderly couple's perspective of family chaos. Yasujiro Ozu was, quite simply, the greatest Japanese filmmaker of all time."
1.0,tokyo_story,"An amazing, timeless film. It hardly felt like two hours. Not from 1972, though. It's originally from 1953."
1.0,tokyo_story,"It's style and pace will seem completely off to most audiences. but Ozu's careful, patient, and sympathetic observations of the small painful moments that string a life together is a miracle to behold. Just try not crying towards the end."
1.0,tokyo_story,Heartbreaking and beautiful.
1.0,tokyo_story,"In it's quiet and subdued way, one of the most heart breaking films ever made. I need to see more Ozu."
1.0,tokyo_story,A quiet masterpiece.
1.0,tokyo_story,"At first I thought that the acting by the parents was poor, but it hit me that it was perfectly executed slow old people acting. Plus I hate to admit that I teared up while watching this movie."
1.0,tokyo_story,"Excellent, excellent, excellent. Ozu is incredibly simplistic with the camera work and lets the story flow very lyrically. Ozu clearly deserves to be mentioned in every conversation of great Japanese filmmakers."
1.0,tokyo_story,"Slow and meditative and certainly not to all tastes, but Ozu's most famous work distills all his formal obsessions and has some wonderful central performances subtly conveying the tensions which are concealed between family members."
1.0,tokyo_story,"Slow, but deeply affecting masterpiece drama by Yasujiro Ozu. A very meditative look into the life of a family and its genderation gaps. It's Yasujiro's best film."
1.0,tokyo_story,"A masterpiece. Life in its ordinariness is full of little intricacies. We forget the old, we remember them when it's too late."
1.0,tokyo_story,My favorite movie that isn't in my language.
1.0,tokyo_story,"So powerful, so beautiful."
1.0,tokyo_story,The film that started my Ozu obsession. Classic.
1.0,tokyo_story,"Heart wrenching, emotional film. I didn't expect it to be so sad, although I think the Criterion cover should've clued me in. The part that affected me the most was when Mother tells Isamu that she wonders if she will be around to see him become a doctor. Nice to see more trains in this film."
1.0,tokyo_story,Slow and absolutely breathtaking
1.0,tokyo_story,"Bleak and moving, but as beautifully filmed as anything has ever been, Tokyo Story defines Ozu's static and understated approach."
1.0,tokyo_story,Touching. Full of emotion.
1.0,tokyo_story,Never has such spare filmmaking evoked so much emotion. This film about taking care of the ones you love has some of the most well written characters in the movies.
1.0,tokyo_story,"Yes, the pace takes getting used to, but Tokyo Story is realistic, stylistic, sentimental and unmanipulative all at the same time."
1.0,tokyo_story,My favorite movie of all time by my favorite director of all time

1.0,tokyo_story,This movie captured my heart and wouldn't let go.

1.0,tokyo_story,Moving drama is a must-see. Beautiful and heartbreaking.
1.0,tokyo_story,Minimal story gives way to setting a tone unlike any other film.
1.0,tokyo_story,One of the most heartbreaking films ever. Very simple story.

1.0,1010792-its_a_wonderful_life,"Arguably one of the best films ever made. Although unpopular at the time of release, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE has become a timeless classic for everyone. Movie is capped off by Stewart's great performance and Capra's excellent direction."
0.0,1010792-its_a_wonderful_life,Well it is definitely not a wonderful movie.
1.0,1010792-its_a_wonderful_life,"Maybe the best holiday film of all-time. There's some real magic at work here from Frank Capra, which is timeless. I almost tear up at the finish every time. I would say, however, that George Bailey probably owes his child's teacher an apology."
1.0,1010792-its_a_wonderful_life,"It's interesting to know that this timeless holiday classic actually wasn't a hit when it first came out on Christmas 1946, but was eventually embraced by millions. Cary Grant was considered for the role, but he was busy filming another excellent film, The Bishop's Wife, playing the angel Dudley."
1.0,1010792-its_a_wonderful_life,It's more wonderful every year I watch it. What makes me marvel at this film so much is how hard it would be to nail all these notes with a modern film.
1.0,1010792-its_a_wonderful_life,Here's my advice: read the Tomatometer description.
1.0,1010792-its_a_wonderful_life,"Has aged quite well from its 1946 release. Great acting, great plot, great everything."

1.0,war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,Serkis and Harrelson sky rocket this movie into being perhaps better than it has any business being. Its commentary on the way we treat one another within society and what truly makes us human is astoundingly visceral and though provoking. Maybe the best film of 2017.
1.0,war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,"Wow. That's all I have to say, it was brilliant. The story is complex and interesting, there were certainly a lot of emotional parts and the action wasn't the best but still one of the best I've seen in a long time."

0.0,boyhood,"Cannot believe the hype of this ""crap"" Wasted a couple of hours of life watching this stupid shit"
1.0,boyhood,A simply beautiful film
1.0,boyhood,My personal best of 2014. The story of a boy from the age of 6 to 18. So beautifully taken. Watching the movie will remind us of our childhood which makes it even more special. Terrific performances by the actors. Richard Linklater had the guts to make something like this and nailed it.
1.0,boyhood,Extremely impactful to the mind and the heart. I think this is a creative work of art. Haven't seen anything like it. Love the young mans character and who he turns out to be. Spot on. Totally nailed it with the way kids of this generation frame up the world and society they are living in.

1.0,boyhood,"It's a movie of small moments, but those moments add up to life. Easy Oscar winner for Best Picture."
1.0,boyhood,12 years. Great story telling. Watching the actors grow up and older was so much better than make up.
1.0,boyhood,"A masterpiece of a film, and a film that should be bragged upon for its boldness and inventiveness alone. Linklater is a genius, and he is in his finest form here, perfectly encapsulating a generation in a film."
0.0,boyhood,"horrible. no point to this movie. acting terrible, script almost as bad. reminded me of a bad made for tv lifetime special"
1.0,boyhood,"A mind blowing trip through nostalgia the experiences of your childhood and teenage years, a cinematic masterpiece that shouldn't be called a movie but an experience, one of my favorite movies of all time and for a good reason too."
1.0,boyhood,This movie takes me back to a place I haven't been in a while. It's a little place called childhood. This movie reminds me so much of the time that I lived in as a kid and captures the life of a child living in the 2000s
0.0,boyhood,This is the worst movie I have seen to date
1.0,boyhood,"The end was so frustrating to me, I don't know what was i expecting but the way it ended was just not what i wanted. The movie itself its amazing and you can see the great result of such a hard effort of 12 years from the cast. Its a really really awesome movie."
1.0,boyhood,Please tell me the sequel will be Adulthood
1.0,boyhood,"a truly incredible film, never seen anything like it. 4.8/5"
1.0,boyhood,Personal yet epic at the same time.
1.0,boyhood,Boyhood is ground breaking in every sense of the word with its great acting from the whole cast and its epic scale which shows the same actor go from a boy to a young man.
0.0,boyhood,"Two hours into the film, I began to notice mundane details. Most boring film I've ever seen. The most memorable part of this movie is Ethan Hawk's cheesy fake mustache, 119 minutes in."
1.0,boyhood,Actors did such a great job maintaining the integrity of the characters throughout the years they filmed this. watch this
0.0,boyhood,"Boooorrrrrring -- for 2 hours and 45 minutes! If they edited this turkey down to 90 minutes, it'd still be just as boring -- but it'd only be boring for 90 minutes."
1.0,boyhood,"Despite being a complete exposing of every teenage boy's life, its hard to find flaws in this passion project from Linklater, who seems to make us laugh and feel hurt as the family go from one pain to another as well as the touching moments of peace Mason gets with his father."
1.0,boyhood,"10. Bellissimo. Fantastico. Stupendo. Completo. Vero. Puro. Uno dei più bei film che io abbia mai visto. Chiunque lo può vedere, non ha età, e ognuno lo può far suo. GUARDATELO."
1.0,boyhood,This movie was almost liking watching my childhood in a movie. Ok except for the whole domestic violence thing.

0.0,boyhood,"Everyone of us has a version of boyhood or girlhood that can be made into a more interesting, or tasteless movie. Salute to the crew for its persistency over 12 years."
1.0,boyhood,"A fantastic telling of a boy's childhood, and the struggles that come along with it."
1.0,boyhood,"Wow! What a honest, deep and self reflecting movie..."
1.0,boyhood,"A bit long, but very well thought out and executed drama."
0.0,boyhood,"One of the most boring movies ever made. I think people may be dazzled by the story of how the movie was made rather than the movie itself. Frankly, that's the only rational explanation I can find to explain all the whoopla surrounding this."
1.0,boyhood,A revelation to modern film making. You've yet to ever see fictional cinema get as close to real life as Boyhood.
1.0,boyhood,"Beautifully shot in a time span of 12 years, Boyhood is a masterpiece of modern cinema, brilliantly exploring the nature of the human condition!"
0.0,boyhood,"The only cool thing about this movie is that they showed all the characters age, but other than that, the movie went absolutely no where. It just dragged on and on and on. Ugh waste of almost 3 hours. I would have liked it a lot more if at least it had a climax or an interesting ending."
0.0,boyhood,Literally nothing happens!! Total waste of time
1.0,boyhood,This was a great movie
1.0,boyhood,"Boyhood is one of the best films of the century. It's emotionally investing, character driven, and it captures youth and coming of age like no other film has. It defines what it means to grow up. It's life, and it's a beautiful one at that."
1.0,boyhood,A 12 Year Phenomenal Masterpiece. Everyone should atleast see this once.
1.0,boyhood,Arquette and Hawk work their magic but would have liked to see a little more from Coltrane. The nostalgia of growing up in the early 2000's makes up for it though. Definitely lives up to the hype.
1.0,boyhood,Great movie... One of the best I see in last year
1.0,boyhood,An elaborate and rich approach for a coming-of-age by Linklater.
0.0,boyhood,"The main premise of this film seems to be that just when you expect that something is going to happen, nothing does. There are better ways to spend 3 hours of your life, or 12 years if you were involved in making it. 3 words sum up this film and its glowing reviews - ""Emperor's New Clothes""."
0.0,boyhood,"Boring, sluggish, lousy script. Cheap resource: the song ""Hero"" in the right place. The best: Patricia Arquette."
1.0,boyhood,Hienoimpia koskaan näkemiäni elokuvia.
0.0,boyhood,"I don't understand why this has such amazing reviews?... Sure it was something different, filmed over 12 years, but it wasn't at all interesting... It was boring and a complete waste of 3 hours of my life."
1.0,boyhood,this movie is a trip! the commitment and sacrifice alone makes it a classic. great performances. groundbreaking. 12 freaking years. I will watch it again and again.
0.0,boyhood,"by far one of the worse non real life movies I have ever seen. I have seen lifetime movies with better acting , i just wasted several hours of my life watching this garbage."
1.0,boyhood,"I'm watching this movie as I'm typing this. I loved the concept. I thought the actor playing Mason was phenomenal. Samantha was funny. It's a drama. I feel bad for the kids, their lives were constantly turned upside down. I wonder if these actors stayed close after? 12 years is a long time."
0.0,boyhood,Imagine buying an Aston Martin then just using it for the school run.
0.0,boyhood,"Totally overrated, horrible dialogues, boring, one star for Patricia Arquette's performance."
1.0,boyhood,"Boyhood está fuera de todo lo convencional; un sensible, desenfadado, intelectual, y casi documental relato sobre la paternidad y la maduración, de inagotables actuaciones y un guión magistral."
1.0,boyhood,Very relatable film. superb acting on the parts of Patricia and Ethan. A bit long but completely worth watching
1.0,boyhood,"This movie reminds me of my childhood, ALOT."
0.0,boyhood,"Quite possibly wasted 159 minutes of my life watching this movie.. No climax, boring, stagnant, and quite honestly a waste of good actresses and actors."
0.0,boyhood,Huh? Too boring to finish.
0.0,boyhood,Terribly long movie. Interesting idea but a poor execution.
0.0,boyhood,"This was just horrible. So god damn boring. What a waste of time. Horribly written dialogue. Acting was ok, but not enough to save this train wreck."
1.0,boyhood,"this is a phenomenal movie. you get to see the boy grow up right in front of your eyes, at times you actually feel like you are there being apart of the family. during the who movie I felt a strong connection with the movie and my life I would strongly recommend this movie."
1.0,boyhood,A very touching story about a typical young boy's journey. What is so great about this film is I can relate to Mason's journey. Very well done
0.0,boyhood,"This film is terrible. Pretentious, dull scenes with terrible acting, uneven pacing, and cringe-worthy dialogue. This film is a bomb & the worst of the Best Picture nominations."
1.0,boyhood,It is not a movie. Its a time-lapse of emotions. A landmark in movie making itself.
1.0,boyhood,"Phenomenal and unforgettable, ""Boyhood"" is a film like no other, and makes it the best film of 2014."
1.0,boyhood,"Richard Linklater perfectly captures a boy's journey to adulthood in Boyhood - with all its ups and downs, joys and sorrows, and all the tedious and exciting moments that makes each kid's journey unique."
0.0,boyhood,"Longest movie ever!!! The concept was cool, but the acting was absolutely terrible!!!! The story was stereotypical and completely uninteresting!"
1.0,boyhood,Simplicity and realism at its finest.
1.0,boyhood,"As I've aged films are usually hit or miss. Perhaps, I could only enjoy it so much at this particular point in my life. What a great, realistic drama-- truly a work of art."
0.0,boyhood,So long and borring. I did not like at all.
1.0,boyhood,12 amazing years of nostalgia. A time-capsule masterpiece.
0.0,boyhood,"Boring, dull, tedious. Interesting concept/idea, lousy movie."
1.0,boyhood,What a refreshing change to all the sequels and re-makes out there. How cool to use the same cast over 12 years!
0.0,boyhood,Horribly whiny actor.
1.0,boyhood,WATCH THIS MOVIE TWICE! AFTER MY FIRST VIEWING I SAID FOUR STARS. WATCH IT AGAIN. THIS FILM IS A PROFOUND MASTERPIECE.
1.0,boyhood,Elgar Coltrane deserves at least three Oscars for his role (s).
1.0,boyhood,A walk down memory lane. Profound. Thinking my son could have sent this to Hollywood as his memoir and had it made as a screenplay. Wonderfully strange.
0.0,boyhood,Pure dreck. More painful than doing at home dentistry.
1.0,boyhood,This is movie is really EPIC. It tells a common story of growing up and is shot over 12 years just like how the story takes place.
1.0,boyhood,"Boyhood is, obviously, a very personal film for director Richard Linklater. A moving epic filmed over the course of 12 years, sprawling with human emotion and capturing life, Boyhood is a flawless masterpiece with a stellar cast, including an Oscar-winning performance by Patricia Arquette."
0.0,boyhood,"Boring, over-long, and lacking in plot. A boy ages from age 6 to 18, and over the course of 165 minutes, very little happens that is interesting or engaging. Filming over 12 years with the same actors ends up being just a gimmick. Should not have even been nominated for best picture."
1.0,boyhood,Simply one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life so far.
1.0,boyhood,Almost three hours of boredom and absolute brilliance. So understated you completely forget there is any acting going on. Like watching a documentary. One of the more original flicks I've seen in ages. I loved Birdman but this movie deserved best picture.
1.0,boyhood,"Um, I don't give out stars like this. This one deserves it though."
1.0,boyhood,"12/14 Plane to Manila. Very interesting movie, especially watching the kids grow. So real. Very different. Make you want to hug your kids."
0.0,boyhood,"A mopey six year old grows up to be a mopey 18 year old. This film is a plot-less, unremarkable slice of life. It's got a cringe worthy ending, to boot. Ehh!"
1.0,boyhood,Phenomenal absolutely phenomenal what a great movie I hope they make another one like this what a creative artistic film
1.0,boyhood,One of those movies that will make you all 'feely' inside long after you've left the theater.
1.0,boyhood,This is the best film of 2014. a masterpiece and groundbreaking in a unique approach of filmmaking.
1.0,boyhood,THIS MOVIE REALLY TOUCH MY HEART
1.0,boyhood,All I can say is WOW!
1.0,boyhood,an amazing journey through lives and from all angles. where there is no good and bad and right and wrong - it's just life. we go through it. great acting by all.
0.0,boyhood,"Half a star is too much for this poor excuse for a film. Spent the lengthy time cringing, groaning, and wondering if anything was going to actually happen. Extremely disappointing."
0.0,boyhood,Worst movie ever. Somebody poke my eyes out.
1.0,boyhood,"I think the power of coming-of-age films stem from the realization of adults as the credits roll. But none as powerful as this one, that made me question about my own childhood, my own choices, and my future."
0.0,boyhood,Even with nothing much going on we still age.
1.0,boyhood,"Watching this film was, personally, a profound trip down memory lane. I'm afraid that anything I say regarding this film won't do it any justice... it was breathlessly touching. One of many things, I felt distressed for Mason's mom as she said ""I thought there would be more""."
0.0,boyhood,Not near as good as all the hype. An Oscar? Please no.
1.0,boyhood,"Despite generally unlikable characters, it's impossible to ignore the genuine interactions, nostalgia, and audacity to create such a powerful and intriguing film."
1.0,boyhood,"Philosophically significant, this movie depicts boyhood at its truest and is not overdone, nor is it underplayed. Very good social commentary."
1.0,boyhood,Not perfect by any means but remarkably spectacular on so many levels. Captures life's essence through every character. What a brilliant piece of work. Unique film experiences like this one not to be taken for granted as they are rare. Director/writer has given his audience a true gift to watch.
1.0,boyhood,A phenomenal piece of art.
1.0,boyhood,94% on my Tomatometer.
1.0,boyhood,One of the most beautiful and well made movies I have ever seen. Very unique and special piece of cinema which I believe is one of or if not the best film of 2014.
0.0,boyhood,exhausting and pointless
1.0,boyhood,"This would probably be the greatest coming of age movie, like, literally."
0.0,boyhood,The only cool thing about this movie is the fact that it was filmed over 12 years and you get to see the same actors getting old... But it's so not worth the 2 hours and 44 minutes you waste watching it!
1.0,boyhood,I LOVE THIS MOVIE SO MUCH!
0.0,boyhood,Ive been having nightmares ever since I watched this movie. The nightmares are that it will never end. Almost 3 hours of absolutely nothing.
1.0,boyhood,Amazing film that shows the everyday struggles with getting older and wiser.
1.0,boyhood,"Can see why Boyhood got an Oscar Nomination. The film was shot over 12 years, of the SAME characters. I thought it was very good. Told a story of a lad in his teen years ie adolescence."
1.0,boyhood,"Compelling from start to finish, Boyhood is brimming with humour, humanity, nostalgia and is ultimately so much more than its filmed-over12-years gimmick. Though that is really cool too. This movie explores the journey of adolescence with honesty yet somehow still manages to be very entertaining."
0.0,boyhood,"Liked the beginning and the...Simply put, I thought it was one of the biggest wastes of my time"

1.0,boyhood,boyhood is a true story about life
1.0,boyhood,"This movie was great. It covered a lot of ground, and seemed to hit home on some real life issues faced by many families around the globe. I will be sure to recommend this to anyone asking for a ""must-see"" flick."
1.0,boyhood,"One of my favorite movies of all time. It's not something you would want to watch too often, but it is a must see and has the ability to make you reflect on your entire life."
1.0,boyhood,"An excellent look at one kid's attempt to make sense of the world around him, helped tremendously by the film's uncommon approach."
0.0,boyhood,"The most random ending to a movie ever, I started to dread it as the movie went on as it could of gone either way. Turns out it just ends with some lame sentiment! It's been deleted from my collection never to waste another 2 hours on!"
1.0,boyhood,Best film of the year and one of the greatest films period. This movie is a master peace.
0.0,boyhood,One of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen. The gimmick of 12 years of shooting means nothing. There is no real STORY. Nothing happens that is even remotely interesting.
0.0,boyhood,"Boring, depressing, and multiple, unnecessary political references. I am shocked that this movie is rated so highly by both critics and users."
1.0,boyhood,Excellent work done..the more than 10 years job was a matter of interest..
1.0,boyhood,"Welcome to life!!!!! What an awesome movie. An coming out of age movie that travels you 12 years back. Ethane Hawke, Patricia Quarette, Richard Linklater all had a job in this masterpiece that will never be forgotten in my whole life."
1.0,boyhood,After countless pretentious love movies or family dramas comes a movie that's was filmed like no other movie before it. Congratulations mr. Linklater you did something original you should be truly proud don't let anyone take this victory from you not even yourself
1.0,boyhood,Probably my favorite movie released in 2014
1.0,boyhood,Should have won best film of 2014.Wonderful!

0.0,boyhood,very long boring movie about a boring average family
1.0,boyhood,"Amazing. 9.5/10. A.Richard Linklater's excellent direction and screenwriting makes Boyhood a thoroughly moving, deeply enthralling and effective experience with a great but realistic outlook on life, and an achievement in filmmaking."
1.0,boyhood,"Almost perfect. A melancholy masterpiece, suffused with enough honesty, optimism and humour to wrap you completely in it's warm embrace. Cinema, once again, feels alive and in very rude health."

1.0,boyhood,An enjoyable film about growing up in a typical disjointed American family.
1.0,boyhood,"Possibly the best film I've ever seen. A real great film that documents a boy and his experiences as he travels to adulthood. An experience that many of us can relate to. A really touching, riveting film that I recommend that everyone should see!"
1.0,boyhood,"Brilliant, brilliant film. Beautifully acted."
0.0,boyhood,"Production spanned over a decade. Sort of like a successful TV series but with a fraction of the work. Somehow a far less interesting plot than most TV shows and still receives Oscar nominations. Go ahead, spend 3 hours on this drawl. I dare you."
1.0,boyhood,I highly recommend this to those in my generation. Linklater perfectly captures the essence of growing up in the 2000's while reminding us how fast time flies. Never have I been so emotionally connected to a film.
0.0,boyhood,"This movie is garbage. All it has going for it is the 12 years gimmick.Nothing happens, and the charactes are bland and lifeless."
1.0,boyhood,What a great movie! So happy I watched this.
1.0,boyhood,"A remarkable film, unlike nothing I have ever seen before. This is something quite special."
1.0,boyhood,"This film is brilliant, well acted and about as relatable as you could want! everyone can find something to relate to in this story of a boy growing up and shot using the same actor throughout the course of his life. visually stunning, moving and ultimately convincing of a boy coming of age."
0.0,boyhood,most boring moving I've seen in years. I don't get all the fuss. at all.
1.0,boyhood,one incredible journey through life and time
0.0,boyhood,This movie was so disappointing. I felt like I just watched 3 hours of home video at someones grandparents house that I had no connection to. I applaud the dedication to filming for 12 years straight but no grandparents got an award for their home videos.
1.0,boyhood,"rare, imaginative, once-in-lifetime movie filmed over 12 years with the same cast. Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette are great and Ellar Coltrane is the boy who grows up before our eyes. You'll never see another film like this."
0.0,boyhood,"Boring. No real story. Just jumping around a regular, not very interesting life."
1.0,boyhood,"Mind-blowing achievement in a quiet, unassuming package."
0.0,boyhood,Way way way way too long.......ugg
0.0,boyhood,"Boring, uneventful. The novelty of true aging of the characters didn't make up for Patricia Arquette's poor performance."
1.0,boyhood,"A culmination of over a decade of investment, Boyhood captures the magic of life and growing up in such a simplistic approach that it feels as if we're growing up all over again while watching it."
0.0,boyhood,Boyhood lacks a story or a single character I was able to feel something for... Please let this go by and save three hours of your life for something meaningful.

1.0,hell_or_high_water,"Hell or High Water is cinematic gold. If at some point you aren't rooting for the bank robbers, are you even watching the movie? Amazingly cast, acting is superb, location scouts served up perfection."
1.0,hell_or_high_water,This movie is my first to give a full 5 stars cause it was simply fantastic from beginning to end. The plot twist at the end was incredibly thought provoking too. It didn't leave you feeling like someone gave up at the end.
1.0,hell_or_high_water,"Excellent movie. ""Gotta love W Texas"" right after the redneck tells the lawman he won't find the body. Great outlaw country soundtrack, too."

1.0,hell_or_high_water,"What, something based on people's love of family? I like movies that entertain me and LOVE movies that surprise me..."
1.0,hell_or_high_water,Für mich einer der besten Filme der letzten Jahre. NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN kann dagegen einpacken! Trotz 4 Oscarnominierungen in den wichtigsten Kategorien ging der Film zu unrecht leer aus.
1.0,hell_or_high_water,"Hell or High Water is filled with tension and levity alongside a compelling journey. Ben Foster is incredible, with Chris Pine and Jeff Bridges giving great performances as well. It's beautifully shot and has a simple but great theme."
1.0,hell_or_high_water,"A good ol' Texas western with Texas spirit. Memorable quote: ""They took everything from your family, this is your chance to take it back. Paying them back with their own money, well if that ain't Texan I don't know what is."""
1.0,hell_or_high_water,I took my time to finally watch it. Boy I was missing one of the finest movies from last year.
1.0,hell_or_high_water,"Great dialog, had to watch it twice to catch everything. Fast action with some surprises. Righteousness drives the plot. Great and appropos music. Loved this movie."

1.0,hell_or_high_water,Excellent film. A simple story well told.

1.0,creed_2015,"In the year of a seventh film in a franchise that started in the 70s with the same premise as the original, this is by far the best one. The filmmaking aspects of Creed honestly rival Rocky. It's criminally underrated, and easily one of the best of the year."
1.0,creed_2015,Very good movie great storyline for rocky fans and kicks of he next generation of the rocky franchise great
1.0,creed_2015,"Modernizes the characters and saga, brings its own spark, and most definitely holds a candle to the best of 'em!"

0.0,creed_2015,"My god, the just get worse and worse"
1.0,creed_2015,This is by far one of my most favorite movies of all time. It is on par with the first Rocky in my book! There are not enough good things that I can say about this one. Sylvester Stallone was ROBBED by not winning an Oscar for this one. Everyone in this is great! It is a must see!
1.0,creed_2015,This movie was amazing from the action and matches to the character development... just everything flawless..
1.0,creed_2015,This Movie is AAAAMAZING a must see
0.0,creed_2015,I tried watching this and just couldn't make it all the way to the end. I shut it off about half way through. Pathetically awful moviemaking.
1.0,creed_2015,Did not see this coming. An awesome boxing movie. I was such a skeptic going into this. I left a tearful believer. Fantastic cinimitography!
1.0,creed_2015,Stallone and Jordan turn in amazing performances that made it much more than typical boxing film. The single shot second fight was insane.
1.0,creed_2015,"This was excellent. Story, camera work, and characters all come together."
1.0,creed_2015,Best one in the series.

1.0,creed_2015,It's Off the chain!!
1.0,creed_2015,This is the perfect rocky movie. It might be better than the first one or as good. Is it as good as other 5star movies? Dark Knight or Se7en? Not really. For what it was going for it is the ultimate rocky movie.

1.0,creed_2015,"Finally got around to seeing this (Amazon Prime)! I'm definitely going to re-watch some of my favorite Rocky movies now. The drama in this episode was deep and meaningful, balanced with a good amount of, though pretty intense, action. If you haven't seen it, make some time to check it out."
1.0,creed_2015,"Creed succeeds in the ring and on the screen thanks to great performances (Michael B.Jordan couldn't get an Oscar nomination?), and great direction from Ryan Coogler."
1.0,creed_2015,I never watched any of the Rocky movies and this movie is by far one of my favorite fighting movies of all time. Im glad the director of this is going to be making Black Panther.

1.0,creed_2015,"To be honest, I didn't expect too much of this movie, but I was wrong. This is fantastic movie. Actors were brilliant, fight scenes were amazing and it has one of the best long takes I have ever seen so far. Highly reccomended for everyone."
1.0,creed_2015,"Creed breathed fresh life into the Rocky series- one that had been buried by not only the world, but Sylvester Stallone himself as well. This spin-off movie not only pleases older Rocky movie fans, but also interests and excites a new generation of movie goers."

1.0,creed_2015,"Just saw CREED today. One of the best films I've seen this DECADE. Deeply moving. Every word rang true. Brilliant performances. Of the seven Rocky films arguably the best after the original. With all the hype for the seventh Star Wars movie, THIS film left me with 100 times more."

1.0,creed_2015,A beautiful movie. May even be better than the first Rocky. Not an action movie and yet a movie that loves Boxing.
1.0,creed_2015,Lives up to the Rocky franchise

1.0,creed_2015,A regular boxing movie
1.0,creed_2015,"Good addition to the rocky films, wouldn't knock the originals out of the ring but still hope they make more"
1.0,creed_2015,I'd say it's easily the 3rd best Rocky movie behind 2 and 4. I honestly can't even remember the last one. Michael B. Jordan probably deserved an Oscar nomination and 100% Sly should have taken home Best Supporting.
1.0,creed_2015,Great sequel to a longtime saga.
1.0,creed_2015,Fantastic! Well acted! Incredibly written!
1.0,creed_2015,One of the best boxing movies I've ever seen. I expected to enjoy it but not on this level. One of the best boxing movies I've seen that holds up next to Rocky as one of the best of this long running series.

1.0,creed_2015,I enjoyed this a lot more than I expected. It was surprisingly touching.

1.0,creed_2015,"That was a hell of a movie!!! Blood sweat and tears, and its an amazing addition to the Rocky story."
0.0,creed_2015,A gigantic piece of doggie doo.

1.0,creed_2015,Loved this movie...loved Sylvester Stallone...brought back so many wonderful memories of watching the first Rocky film and cheering along with everyone else in the theatre when he won the fight. Stallone should have won the Oscar.

1.0,creed_2015,Awesome! Loved it! Great freaking movie!
1.0,creed_2015,"There's a lot more boxing in this movie than there is in other boxing movies - and I liked that. Such a visceral film, with visceral performances by both Jordan and Stallone. Also, the portrayal of Philly: simultaneously honest and nostalgia-inducing."
1.0,creed_2015,"Very well-done sequel / spin-off in the Rocky series. Stallone got a richly deserved win of a Golden Globe and was, rightful so, nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor."
1.0,creed_2015,Excellent as good as the first
1.0,creed_2015,"What a fitting conclusion (?) to the Rocky story! This is probably the 2nd best entry in the series. It's a boxing story, love story and family story all rolled into one. And most importantly NEVER forget who you are and where you came from. Should have been nominated for Best Picture."
1.0,creed_2015,A very interesting take on the up-and-coming boxer story. Stallone and Jordan give great performances. Camera work during the boxing is really cool.
1.0,creed_2015,good movie. recommend
1.0,creed_2015,"Takes aim at it's target from the very beginning and gives it a first round KO. Ryan Coogler brings a welcome new view to a franchise that you think has exhausted all avenues, obviously not. Stellar performances from Stallone and Jordan"

1.0,creed_2015,I was unsure when I went to see this one - but it turned out to be a great movie. Very entertaining and fun..
1.0,creed_2015,"Incredible! I did not expect the 7th movie in the 'Rocky' franchise to be one of my favorite movies of 2015. I loved it! Mark Rylance better have one heck of a performance in 'Bridge of Spies', because Sylvester Stallone was lights out (Michael B. Jordan killed it too)."
1.0,creed_2015,So inspirational! Such great acting and so engaging! It was action packed and moving all in one movie. Best movie I've seen all year!

0.0,creed_2015,"Poorly cast and as a result, poor acting performances throughout. The plot was terrible. Angry black kid talks all kinds of angry shit and then loses the fight? Waste of time. It's a terrible movie. Ended in the same way as two other Rocky films (Rocky and Balboa)."

1.0,1000642-all_quiet_on_the_western_front,"This movie is certainly a master piece even to today's standards, surely at the time it was made, it had very little competition!"
1.0,1000642-all_quiet_on_the_western_front,This movie is so far ahead of it's time it floored me. This movie would stand up to any contemporary war film and was possibly even more artistic. Everyone should see this film.
1.0,1000642-all_quiet_on_the_western_front,One of my favourite war films and my favourite anti-war movie
1.0,1000642-all_quiet_on_the_western_front,"Gritty, this movie retains all the grit and mud that was WWI. The entire movie paints a feeling of dred in the air, as if you know there is no happy ending. Masterfully written and performed, it accomplished it's its purpose of showing the depressing and sometimes pointlessness of war."
1.0,1000642-all_quiet_on_the_western_front,"I was amazed by this film. Made in 1930, this is an absolute classic. Definetley right up there with the best war movie i have ever seen. Could not be more impressed by this film."
1.0,1000642-all_quiet_on_the_western_front,"Incredible, particularly for its day. Really well-directed and a very bleak look at war - namely World War 1. It seems well ahead of its time and both removes the glamour and satirises those outside the war looking in."
1.0,1000642-all_quiet_on_the_western_front,Let the cry-fest begin!

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,Wonderful film. I have seen it twice and look forward to watching it again. The sweet way that Charlie falls for Rose is something that only two wonderful actors can portray. The scene where Bogart imitates the hippos and makes her laugh is adorable. The wedding is unforgettable.

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"John Huston filmed his World War I epic on location, which was an unusual decision at the time, but the grittiness and festering of the jungle perfectly matches the griminess of our main characters, played by Bogart and Hepburn."

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"The 1951 classic that won Humphrey Bogart an Oscar and inspired the Jungle Cruise at Disneyland was every bit as awesome as I had pictured it. The special effects are definitely of their time, but that doesn't stop it from being a timeless film."
1.0,the_african_queen_1951,The first of a series of boy meets girl and they take on the world. Once again a classic movie with two of the greatest actors to ever live. Joe versus the Volcano might be said to be a take off of AQ. Very loosely. Same struggles different picture.

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"The African Quee directed by John Huston. Finally John Huston had Humphrey Bogart win his only Best Actor Oscar Award, Katharine Hepburn brings charm both to film and the character of Humphrey Bogart. A thriller film, notably near the climax scene."

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"not the best bogey our katherine, but the most vivid and beautiful dynamic amongst them explodes across a backdrop so impossibly grand and metaphorically imperfect a never in a lifetime tale of unspoken dissonance dances on long after the credits fade."

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"A very good film, staring Audrey Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart. It's a romance with lots of action and some comedy in it; it's set durring WWI in Africa as they take a small boat, the African Queen, down a dangerous river in order to destroy a gargantuous German ship."

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"The relationship between Bogey and Hepburn is marvelous, as they first despise each other and then long for one another. Charlie Alnut is one of cinema's best characters, often overshadowed by Bogey's own Fred C. Dobbs. A trek well-worth the taking."
1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"There are a couple stars in each generation that steal our hearts so completely we'll watch anything they're in. Bogey and Kate are both such stars, and to see them together in a well-made (John Huston) film is a delight worth savoring again and again."

Hepburn is so wonderfully repressed in the beginning ... watching their intial interactions is almost painful. But alas this movie does have a happy end and we do see a marked change in both characters.

1.0,bicycle_thieves,"Simply brilliant. De Sica adds such a sense of realism that you feel like you suffer along main character, Ricci. Bicycle Thieves fortunately doesn't follow the stereotypical Hollywood movie of that time and ultimately delivers a powerful social commentary."

1.0,bicycle_thieves,"Most serious critics say it's one of the best films of all time. It is. When I saw a student sending a text-message during the heartbreaking scene where Bruno watches his father get humiliated by an angry mob, I wanted to kick that cell-phone across the auditorium."

1.0,bicycle_thieves,I had my bike stolen twice but it was never this bad...
1.0,bicycle_thieves,"A masterpiece of Italian neo-realism. As Arthur Miller once described, Bicycle Thieves is about man's 'search for dignity'. He couldn't be more correct in describing this heartbreaking story of a man and his son trying to find his stolen bike. It will floor you."

1.0,battleship_potemkin,I watched this while a full symphony orchestra played a musical score put together from Shostakovich's symphonies. It knocked my socks off. Almost too strong. I almost longed for a good old-fashioned silent film piano.
1.0,battleship_potemkin,"Up there with ""The Graduate"" and ""Citizen Kane"", they say. Brilliantly cut. Often copied never surpassed."
1.0,battleship_potemkin,may be a silent film filled with thugly russians - but tells a story better then anything out of holloywood-plus a tasteful dose of propaganda never hurt anyone.

1.0,battleship_potemkin,Attention all you silent film haters out there: do yourself a favor and check this one out. It's just an all-around great movie. Any serious film buff needs to watch this movie at least once. It's as fast-paced and exciting as any of the modern blockbusters.

1.0,battleship_potemkin,"Eisenstein is one of my favourite director now. He has portrayed something that was impossible in 1925. Brilliant. The editing sequences, the camera angles is very brilliantly done. Not a single frame space is wasted. He was the best, is the best and will remain the best."

1.0,battleship_potemkin,"I'm sure Stalin loved this movie, but so what? He should have. It's a masterpiece. Everything from the maggots on the meat to the fading images of the men hanging from the poles to massacre on the steps of Odessa, are some of the many reasons this movie was far ahead of its time."
1.0,battleship_potemkin,A Soviet silent gem. This movie was the inspiration for so many other great films. Eisenstein was a genius of his time and his own life would make an excellent movie.
1.0,battleship_potemkin,"Perhaps Eisenstein's greatest film; a perfect example of his dialectical theory of montage. The narrative and cinematography are nothing like what we're accustomed to today, so be prepared to do some work on the audience end in order to get what Eisenstein's up to here."
1.0,battleship_potemkin,A tour de force of revolutionary cinema. Experience it.
1.0,battleship_potemkin,I love this movie. The cinematography is amazing...so many haunting memorable scene. 10 stars!

1.0,battleship_potemkin,"Groundbreaking cinema from Eisenstein. This has a warm place in my heart, as I've had the pleasure of visiting the Potemkin steps in Odessa."
1.0,battleship_potemkin,"The film is famous for its ""Odessa's Steps"" sequence, but it's actually magnificent from beginning to end. Propaganda it is, yes, but it shines techincal and artistic brilliance. One of the greatest cinematic tragedies is that Eisenstein was never able to make films outside the Soviet system."

1.0,french_connection,"A crime thriller that shoulds be one of the best of all times. Gene Hackman as ""Popeye"" Doyle a non brilliant cop but a obssesive and stubborn one to get what his intuition says. A fabulous chase scene with Doyle in a car running behind the metro train."

1.0,french_connection,"excellent cast, story. screenplay"
1.0,french_connection,"It is of course a classic, and cool to see how this 1971 movie set the trend for a different kind of realism in cop dramas. And Hackman and Scheider are so young."

1.0,french_connection,"A tense, thrilling, powerful and fast paced thriller, The French Connection is easily one of the best thrillers around and its helped because of its outstanding performances and impeccable direction."
1.0,french_connection,A masterpiece from Friedkin. Popeye Doyle is probably my all time favourite cops. Hackman is on fire and that fricking car chase. A wonerful tale of cat and mouse.

0.0,french_connection,"It may have had relevance as a new style in 1971, but this film has little appeal today.

1.0,french_connection,"Well, this ""dirty cop"" drama is quite odd, but of course as humorous, expertly well-acted, and action-wise the most thrilling of all-time. A 1971 Pontiac LeMans vs. an elevated train (with a fleeing hitman onboard) is what makes this film famous."
1.0,french_connection,"The original gritty, urban cop movie. Gene Hackman proves you don't have to be pretty when you know how to kick ass."
1.0,french_connection,"Slick, well-plotted, and with a terrific cast. Hackman never fails to deliver, and Scheider is great as well. This is a phenomenal movie, and a defining film of its generation. The critic that gave this a rotten should be tarred and feathered."

1.0,french_connection,"Great movie, fantastic car chase. Can't beat 70's cinema."
1.0,french_connection,"A movie that goes far beyond a memorable car chase scene, The French Connection maintains full force to date by the raw picture of urban decay, and above all by the coldly pessimistic ending, possible reflections of the North American political scene of then."

1.0,french_connection,"Best Cop movie ever. Best Car Chase in a movie ever, Bullitt sucks. Popeye rocks!"
1.0,french_connection,Ambiguity is what elevates this film above typical cop/action genre. The moral uncertainty encountered throughout the movie perfectly characterizes New York City in the 1970s- not a happy place to be. Futility is the name of the game.

1.0,french_connection,"Along with Bullitt and Dirty Harry, this is one of the best of those gritty action movies that came out in the late 60s/early70s.

1.0,french_connection,"No mincing, straight as a die action film carried through with Hackmann's portrayl of a pyschopathic Doyle. One of the best films ever made."
1.0,french_connection,My favorite crime drama. Doesn't get any better than this.
1.0,french_connection,Possibly the only man more bad ass than Clint Eastwood. As a matter of fact I think I'll be watching Unforgiven next.
1.0,french_connection,Nametag-worthy (some people know what that means). Among the best cop-thrillers in existence.
1.0,french_connection,A gritty police drama shot in a documentary style that plays like a roller-coaster ride with a deserving Oscar-winning performance from Gene Hackman.
1.0,french_connection,One of best detective movie.
1.0,french_connection,"This is a fucking sirloin steak and baked potato of a movie. Filling as hell. That car chase is peerless, and the movie looks like it was filmed, then pulled from the camera to put on a reel. This is potent movie. And to paraphrase Dave, ""Amawesafuckingmazing""."
1.0,french_connection,"Could be the best car chase ever, and a damn good cop movie."
1.0,french_connection,"Very gritty, very realistic, very well directed. One of Hackman's best performances to date. One of the most hard nosed, wholly absorbing cop films ever made."
1.0,french_connection,"the man on the box for this movie is holding a gun. it stars gene hackman as the man with the gun and the giant hand. i have not seen this movie. it says ""five star collection"" on top of the box. i give this movie five stars."
1.0,french_connection,Gripping movie about drug smuggling
1.0,french_connection,Among my all time favorites. I don't know why.
1.0,french_connection,"Absolutely spectacular cop film from director William Friedkin. Gene Hackman is Popeye Doyle, a New York cop who has a method all his own. The action and excitement don't let up for a second, and this film won the Oscar for Best Picture, 1971. Don't miss it!"
1.0,french_connection,The movie is one of the undisputed must-sees of all time. A pioneer for every cop film that will follow.
1.0,french_connection,"The car chase is better than in Batman Begins. A true movie classic, I just love every single detail about this movie."
1.0,french_connection,"One of my eternal favorites! The car chase is actually better than the one in Bullitt, primarily because it looks totally unrehearsed. Plus, Hackman's one of the greatest actors that ever lived & the story is consistently intriguing."
1.0,french_connection,god damn Hackman is such a hero
1.0,french_connection,Hackman is in his element here. The photography makes New York look grimy as hell. ANd the car chase is that good.
1.0,french_connection,"list is not in numerical order, and is not complete."
1.0,french_connection,one of the best films of the 1970s starring Gene Hackman and also The French Connection comes under the direction of William Friedkin. a very interesting movie. worth seeing.
1.0,french_connection,Fantastic approach to film making with almost a documentary feel to it. Great acting by Hackman and Scheider and excellent direction by Friedkin.
1.0,french_connection,"That really is Gene Hackman howling like a banshee while he dodges the other cars. And the film makers didn't apply for permits, so those are actual innocent bystanders scattering in all directions - including that woman with the baby carriage. Yikes!"
1.0,spider_man_homecoming,"Best comic book film I have ever seen in my life. That says a lot. From the great supporting characters, to the best MCU villian i have ever seen, this movie succeeds in every possible way i could imagine, if you have not seen this movie than you must, this film is perfect, simply perfect. 5/5."

1.0,spider_man_homecoming,"I was not sure if I would like this one, yet another spider man re-boot, booooring, but no... oddly enough, the inclusion of Tom Holland as a hapless superhero, without all the mind-numbing girlfriend angst that normally accompanies this age-old hero staple, was very refreshing and fun to watch."

0.0,spider_man_homecoming,Juvenile. It was too focused on teenage antics. They added Ironman which made it worse. Then they made this thing with his aunt and Ironman. It was just not cute. The only redeeming factor was Michael Keaton's acting performance.
0.0,spider_man_homecoming,Disney spent more time making sure the cast was unique and coming up with names for 'mary jane but not mary jane' than they did making sure the movie wasn't yet another vomited up remake. People will watch anyway.

1.0,sunset_boulevard,"One of the great film noirs, this movie stands the test of time. Brilliantly written and brilliantly acted."
1.0,sunset_boulevard,"One of my all time favorite films. This is as good as movies get. The comedy, the noir elements, Swanson's campiness and melodrama are all a perfect fit.

1.0,sunset_boulevard,"One of Hollywood's best -- and a satire of Hollywood itself, one that gets better with age."

1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"Great movie. Endlessly cynical, and the killer dialogues could make anyone's day. Burt Lancaster should have won an oscar for his brilliant performance as the seedy, malevolent J.J. Hunsecker.

1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"This is my type of film. The two main characters are downright despicable. Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis are both amazing in this film.

1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,Tony Curtis is great in this surprisingly dark tale about the underworld of New York's gossip collumnists and press agents. The film features some stunning black and white photography and is very much an oft overlooked classic.
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"'Cat's in the bag and the bag's in the river.Just a flat terrible movie, but it pulses rhythmically like the beat of a drum and grows on you because of that hip, street wise dialogue you only wish you had the literate wit to say in normal conversation."

1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,Absolutely brilliant.
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"Before America took capitalism for granted these guys ""looked"" bad. So it's kind of like normal assholes portrayed to look like vampires or deranged zealots. Hitchcock couldn't have made these jerks any more creepy."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"A wonderfully cool, stylish movie that dissects the sleazy world of PR and gossip masquerading as journalism. Tony Curtis is remarkable as the desperate PR guy, hungry for success and losing everything that matters as he chases it."

1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"Every single character in this nightcrawling noir masterpiece is tainted, corrupted and compromised. Add Clifford Odets' and Ernest Lehmann's poetry-of-malice dialog and James Wong Howe's photography and it achieves a rancid perfection."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"A film noir that proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that humans of all types, not just criminals and gangsters, can be full of malice, deceit and a smooth, serpentine evil. Scary."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,Just a masterpiece. One of the tightest and sharpest scripts I've ever come across.
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,this is a movie with modern sensibilities beyond its age. strong characters and an unremorsfull plot makes this a truly vintage piece of cinema

1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"I LOVE this movie - dialogue is fantastic, look is all noir, the weird unspoken unconsumated incestuousness on Hunsecker's part in a 50's movie, all the evil motivations of the people, & probably the best performance of Tony Curtis' life."

1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,It only gets better with every viewing. One of the darkest scripts ever to surface.
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"When it comes to noir, here's the most venomous of them all. Lancaster and Curtis go head-to-head spewing acid like it's going out of style. It pulls no punches, hits about as hard as Ace in the Hole, and features one of the most brilliant scripts in film history."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"Stayed good, stayed sharp, stayed brutal, didn't stay staid."

1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"One of my favorite works of noir. I really enjoy the stark potrayl of New York and show buisness which is usally just seen in musicals during this period. Really enjoyed everyone (Curtis, Lancaster...) especially Martin Milner in a pre Jack Webb role."

1.0,double_indemnity,"Can't believe I finally got around to this.. Brilliant! My favorite noir film yet. MacMurray's performance could have been played exactly the same today in 2011 and one wouldn't know the difference. Fresh and witty, downright brillz. Enough for me to actually rate it. ;-)"

1.0,double_indemnity,"The greatest of all the classic film noirs!!!

1.0,double_indemnity,"The greatest film noir ever made (in my humble opinion). MacMurray, Stanwyck, and Robinson go great work, and Wilder's direction is exemplary."
1.0,double_indemnity,Maybe the best Film-Noir of all-time. Many suspenseful moments keep the viewer on the edge of his seat from start to finish. Avoid the 1973 remake at all costs. Richard Crenna and Samantha Eggar are awful at trying to re-create the sexual tension between Fred MacMurray and Barbra Stanwyck.
1.0,double_indemnity,"Absolutely incredible writing. Although Wilder and Chandler did not get along... at all, they produced an incredible screenplay and what has been named the best Film Noir picture of all time. ""Hold on to that cheap cigar,"" cause this is a classic you cannot miss."

1.0,double_indemnity,A good film noir to start with if you are just a beginner.
1.0,double_indemnity,This is a fantastic film noir that deserves all the acclaims it has received. Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck do an excellent job of their roles but the shining here is the great Edward G. Robinson.
0.0,double_indemnity,"I realize that Noir means that morals and values are up for debate, but I didn't really care for anyone in this movie. It was very well done, and I feel that it succeeded in what in originally intended to accomplish...but Double Indemnity is just not the movie for me."

1.0,double_indemnity,Barbara Stanwyck is the ultimate femme fatale in this classic film noir.

1.0,double_indemnity,Excellent movie. Film noir at its finest.
1.0,double_indemnity,"fantastic film. normally I'd be complaining about a film with relatively no subtext, completely story driven, but I don't know that I've ever seen a story so perfectly told from beginning to end.

1.0,double_indemnity,"I can watch this again and again, always entertaining"
1.0,double_indemnity,"Billy Wilder is one of my big movie heroes and Double Indemnity is one of his very best films. I hadn't watched this one in years till it came on TCM and I found myself just as mesmorized as when I first saw it as a kid. Anyone studying film, especially screenwriters, should not miss this one."
1.0,double_indemnity,"CINE NEGRO en su maxima expresion. Wilder maneja el suspense a sus anchas, gracias a un guion, unos dialogos y unas secuencias inolvidables...""No oia mis propios pasos, eran los de un hombre muerto..."""
1.0,double_indemnity,This is definitely one of my favorite noirs now. The film was really suspenseful and felt kinda like a Hitchcock movie.
1.0,double_indemnity,"""Love and murder at first sight"" Fred MacMurray is sunk by his crave for money and for the enticing Barbara Stanwyck. Amoral, snappy and tense exercise of suspense; and probably Miss Stanwyck's finest hour. Rounded noir perfection."

1.0,double_indemnity,Classic of the 1940s film noir genre. It is also a mystery movie at its best.
1.0,double_indemnity,"There is a reason why Billy Wilder is my favorite director ever--this movie is it. This is the definitive film noir classic. The story and interpretation are as fresh today as they were in 1944. Riveting, engaging, and knock-your-socks-off chemistry between MacMurray and Stanwyck. Whoah!"
1.0,double_indemnity,My quintessential Noir story. Chandler's dialogue is pure ear candy here and with more twists than a five-foot curly frie it's fresh each and every time I watch. So damn good it should be made illegal.
1.0,double_indemnity,"It doesn't get any better with MacMurray and Stanwyck, so combined with Robinson and that hard-as-marble Chandler/Wilder dialogue, well, it's just over."
1.0,double_indemnity,"Line for line, this is arguably the best dialogue ever filmed. And any argument would be short, loud and probably contain the word sh@thead."
1.0,double_indemnity,"This deliciously evil and passionate tale of greed and betrayal is perhaps one of the darkest yet finest pieces in film noir form. Stanwyck shines like a beacon, but it is Wilderâ??s direction that is the genreâ??s trailblazer."

1.0,double_indemnity,The Essential film noir
1.0,double_indemnity,"So, so good. Barbara Stanwyck smolders as Phyllis Dietrichson, but the relationship between Fred MacMurry as Walter Neff and Edward G. Robinson as Keyes is the heart of the film. One of the best examples of the noir genre."
1.0,double_indemnity,"If like me, you grew up watching reruns of My Three Sons, film noir Fred MacMurray will be a revelation to you.

1.0,city_lights,"Despite some gaps in logic such as the cure, and the eccentric millionaire parts, this film contains the most tender romance in the history of film, and thus, rightly deserves its masterpiece status. It is Chaplin's crowning glory, and possibly the greatest ending in the history of film."
1.0,city_lights,"(SPOILER ALERT) This film gave me another definition of comedy: ""A misunderstanding blown way out of proportion"" -- this is evident when our beloved Tramp is mistaken for a burglar, even though his millionaire friend gave him one grand to give to his leading lady."
1.0,city_lights,"Falling in love with a blind flower girl and befriending a suicidal millionaire are just a few of the Tramp's antics in this fun Chaplin classic. Although the plot and resolution can seem a little far-fetched and ridiculous, I would argue this to be Charlie Chaplin's finest work."

1.0,city_lights,"this is the best silent film ever made, near-flawless."
1.0,city_lights,"The epitome of Humanist Cinema. Anyone who can get through the final frames of this Film with dry eyes should undergo a drastic reevaluation of his/her life. For if it be so, something has been torn from his/her soul somewhere along the way --- possibly never to be regained."
1.0,city_lights,"If ever a comedian pushed the limits of a genre that gets little to no critical recognition, it was Chaplin. This film sums up all of the greatest possibilites you can acheive when you dangerously mix comedy and sentiment. He pulls it off beautifully in this film."

1.0,city_lights,The last scene slew me...
1.0,city_lights,Timeless Romantic Comedy
1.0,city_lights,"One of the best movies ever. Totally groundbreaking at that time. Chaplin is capable to blend different sublime sketches into one harmonious storyline. Every scene,every part fluidly rolls into the other, the acting is perfect and hilarious."
1.0,city_lights,Charlie Chaplin can express more with a look than most can with a torrent of words. Subtlety at its finest.
1.0,city_lights,"see it, we are watching a legend here"
1.0,city_lights,Chaplin's masterpiece. City Lights remains 77 years later one of the most moving films I've ever seen and one of the great movie love stories. Chaplin remains one of the funniest actors in cinema and his films remain some of the most perfect and sentimental.
1.0,city_lights,I loved it!! It was so great. Chaplin never fails to get a laugh.
1.0,city_lights,OBRA MAESTRAAAAAAAAAAAAA
1.0,city_lights,"Absolutely brilliant. Heart wrenching, hilarious, such a prime example of what film can really be, so early in the medium's youth."
1.0,city_lights,"One of the best movies. Sweet, romantic, funny, silly, kooky. . .just superb"
1.0,city_lights,Fully lived up to its reputation.
1.0,city_lights,One of the most wonderful films I've ever seen.
1.0,city_lights,Chaplin's first masterpience
1.0,city_lights,"Best Movie ever made...the comedy is funnier; the romance is more genuine; the pathos is pathos-ier... if you get a chance, see it with an audience."
1.0,city_lights,"City Lights is the #1 Romantic Comedy according to AFI and I agree hands down. If you enjoy the genre this masterpiece is a must see. It will make you laugh, cry and it will linger in your thoughts long after watching it. How many movies can do that?? Not many."
1.0,city_lights,I don't know if a movie can ever get any better than this.
1.0,city_lights,so sweet and funny. it's so fun watching this movie over again and noticing all of the things that have been referenced in so many other films and tv shows.
1.0,city_lights,He he. Morsom film som må sees. Ikke bli skremt av at det er en stumfilm.
1.0,city_lights,Charles Chaplin is a movie-making genius. I dare you not to laugh!
1.0,city_lights,Deffinently one of Chaplin's Greatest films.
1.0,city_lights,I think this is Chaplin's best film. Chaplin is at his best and the emotional roller coaster ride you go on in this movie leaves you exhausted by the end (in a good way). You can't help but feel for The Tramp as he does everything he can to help this blind flower girl.
1.0,city_lights,"A la fin, quand la jolie fleuriste dÃ©couvre l'identitÃ© de son bienfaiteur, impossible de ne pas fondre en larmes."
1.0,city_lights,"Beautiful set pieces. The blind girl. The Tramp. And the flowers. A great romantic delight from start to end. The prizefight part is one of the early comedies greatest achievement. And the final scene is just hearbreaking, despite the fact that the couple find each other in the end."
1.0,city_lights,The best Charlie Chaplin film!
1.0,city_lights,My favorite Chaplin performance and one of his best ever. Both poignant and prodigious in the era of Silent Films. An ardent display of great pantomime comedy and solemn romance that has an ending that will make you reach for a tissue.
1.0,city_lights,"The ending of this movie says it all. If you can watch it and not shed a tear you are in need of a doctor to check for a pulse. This movie is moving, funny, and a true classic."
1.0,city_lights,"This film just makes me feel overwhelmingly happy! A rare occurance, and probably the only romance I will ever like."
1.0,city_lights,Wow. This is something special.
1.0,city_lights,Easily one of the best movies ever made. =]
1.0,city_lights,Great movie. For a silent film it manages to have humor and romance blended in well together. The final scene is impeccable.
1.0,city_lights,Definitely one of the best endings to any film I've seen.
1.0,city_lights,"Not only is the film funny, but it contains a great measure of poignancy. End scene is *the* most moving in cinema."
1.0,city_lights,Classic silent cinema from a great pantomime. The resolution with City Lights may be one of the best in cinema. A funny and charming narrative with the beautiful Virginia Cherril.
1.0,city_lights,"Bellissimo. La scena finale è la più commovente della storia del cinema. E' divertentissimo, ma è anche drammatico, è romantico ma è anche impegnato, la musica (dello stesso Chaplin) è incredibile; c'è tutto, manca solo il sonoro ma non ci si fa proprio caso..."
1.0,city_lights,"One of those shows which directors repeatedly pay homage to, and deservingly so. The acting, comic timing, visual gags, and the lovely lovely ending make this timeless. And the boxing match is arguably one of the best comic scenes ever."
1.0,city_lights,Chaplin's most emotionally rich film. The final scene is a tearjerker.
1.0,city_lights,"This seems to be considered Chaplin's ""masterpiece"" by many, but my favorite is still Modern Times."
1.0,city_lights,"La mejor historia de amor se cuenta en silencio. Definitivamente una de las peli­culas que uno debe ver para decir ""yo he vivido""."
1.0,city_lights,Absolutely priceless...This film set the bar for all romantic comedies to come and very few (if any) have managed to live up to it.
1.0,city_lights,"tho i still think ""Modern Times"" is Chaplin's best...this one nearly ties it.....an absolute must see..the scene where the cat knocks the pot onto Chaplin's head while he sniffs the girl's flower is HILARIOUS...also the boxing match-PRICELESS..and then of course the tearjerker ending =masterpiece"
1.0,city_lights,Beautiful! I haven't been able to stop thinking about it.
1.0,city_lights,"Whatever superlative you like, use it."
1.0,city_lights,"It may be a silent movie, but the movie speaks volumes."
1.0,city_lights,A silent movie so good that even my 9 and 5 year olds love it.
1.0,city_lights,simply amazing. the ending truly is one of the greatest in cinema
1.0,city_lights,"Excellent Charles Chaplin film. Behind 'Modern Times' and 'The Great Dictator' for me, but it was amazing. One of the simplest definitions of a romantic comedy before the genre lost its touch along the way."
1.0,city_lights,"If the ending doesn't make you cry, you have no soul.Endlessly brilliant, funny, and so delightful; no matter how many times I watch it, it remains fresh, and further proves the genius of Charles Chaplin."
1.0,city_lights,My favorite Chaplin film. Everyone should see this movie about Chaplin's love for a blind flower girl and his attempts to get money from a drunken millionaire to restore her eyesight. The boxing scene is classic Chaplin and the ending is sure to bring a tear to your eye.
1.0,city_lights,THE LAST MINUTE.OH MY GOD.

1.0,city_lights,"Arguably Chaplin's greatest silent, ""City Lights"" is a true masterpiece. With the universal message that love is blind, ""City Lights"" is a comedy that could make you cry (if you're the type--I personally never cry during movies)."
1.0,city_lights,"Saw this in my film class and enjoyed it quite a bit. Charlie Chaplin was hilarious, but the scenes with his crush were what stood out for me. Just a great movie overall."
1.0,city_lights,"Perfection in pantomime. Absolutely the best film ending, ever!"

1.0,city_lights,Funny and sweet. A beautiful film all around.
1.0,city_lights,Comic gold. Charlie Chaplin was a genius. Absolutley splendid.

1.0,city_lights,"Funny, touching, brilliant. One of the greatest film endings ever. I love this movie."
1.0,city_lights,One of the best Chaplins of all time. Also was listed as the top romantic movie according to the AFI. The boxing scene is also one of Chaplin's most classic+hilarious gags. Just a phenominal piece of movie making.
1.0,city_lights,I'm a big fan of Chaplin and hadn't seen it yet. When I saw recently that it was chosen as AFI's top romantic comedy of all-time I figured I was really missing out. I was right. It's a sweet story with great performances.
1.0,city_lights,His final smile is priceless. Chaplin shows more romantic passion here than most other movies without the benefit of a single spoken word. Timeless.
1.0,city_lights,One of my absolute favorite movies.
1.0,city_lights,Nobody does it better.
1.0,city_lights,Beautiful story... still fresh!

1.0,city_lights,Toda la pelicula y en especial la escena donde la cieguita confunde al vagabundo con un rico son geniales
1.0,city_lights,"AFI recently named this the greatest romantic comedy of all time. I agree. This movie combines pathos and comedy in a completely unique way. Probably the best final scene of all time in a movie. If you only see one silent film in your life, this would be the one to see. Long live the Tramp!!!"
1.0,city_lights,A very cute love story!
1.0,city_lights,One of the greatest movies ever made!

1.0,city_lights,"Chaplin, come ha fatto Benigni con LA VITA E' BELLA, riesce a toccarci in cuore cosi' puramente attraverso la commedia. Il suo personaggio Il Tramp e' puro e sincero in ogni sua azione di tenereza, pericolo, malinteso. Alla fine di questo film, lei veramente riesce a vedere lui!"

1.0,city_lights,Chaplin's masterpiece.
1.0,city_lights,A very good classic black and white movie. It is sad and hopeful. I would really like to know what's happening AFTER the end. (My daughter's favourite part is the boxing game. She is 5 years and loves Charlie Chaplin.)

1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"The whole emphasis on the fate of the banditos at the end of the film completes Huston's moral tale and while it has its flaws, it's perhaps the better noir in comparison with ""The Maltese Falcon"" and ""The Asphault Jungle."""

1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"Bogart gives a superb performance in this sharp, well-executed thriller. It's been made predictable through countless imitations (including a SIMPSONS episode), but it still works."
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,Bogart never ceases to amaze me. This is arguably his best performance.What a ballsy script for 1948... or at least violent. And possibly one of the few films of the era without some sort of romance in it.
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"Excellent, the mexicans in this movie are iconic. Bogart is a paranoid gold panner, absolutely one of the best films ever made"
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,Best Bogart performance ever. Even better performance by Walter Huston.
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"Now that I know how amazing this movie is, I find it insane that I took so long to finally see it. Bogie really shows his range here.

1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,The movie Bogart should have won the oscar for!
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,Without a doubt the best movie ever made about greed and its accompanying paranoia. Humphrey Bogart was never better than as Fred C. Dobbs. This is a classic movie that everyone should see. Supremely entertaining!

1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"Classic Movie.. Talks abt ""Men & their Greed for money""..."
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,I revisited this film recently. It's still one of the great adventure stories but at the same a fascinating morality play on the corrupting nature of greed. Humphrey Bogart gives one of his career best performances in this one. His descent into madness in nothing short of superb.
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"We don't need no stinking badges! No, seriously, this film will rock your socks off. Keep an eye out for Walter Huston's crazyman dance and maniacal giggling, he completely outdoes himself and upstages Bogey."

1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,Best Bogart movie ever!
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,Fantastic. The treasure is found right when they get there- and the rest of the adventure is trying to hang on to both it and their sanity. Fantastic tale- not sure why Bogie's top credit (probably because he's the man) this one belongs to Tim Holt hands down.

1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"What more could be said about this classic? In my opinion, movies simply do not get any better than this."
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,Humphrey Bogart's best film and a tale well worth telling. They just don't make 'em like they used to. This is probably the best movie that searches into the evolution of materialism and the downfall of the greedy.
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"Hard to classify adventure movie, one of Bogie's best performances. Great human drama that hits at the dark core of humanity in some chilling scenes. In its quiet way, the film builds slowly to a surprising and darkly ironic climax that is unforgettable."

1.0,once_upon_a_time_in_the_west,Best. Western. Ever. Made. Juror #8 is one of the scariest villains in film history. Bronson couldn't be tougher. Leone is the best action director there ever was.

1.0,once_upon_a_time_in_the_west,Amazing film. Charles Bronson hunts down Henry Fonda. Sergio Leone films each shot like a painting. Set peices go on for minutes. The first 40 minutes are essentially a few beatufully shot scenes. The end is amazing. A stunning film.
