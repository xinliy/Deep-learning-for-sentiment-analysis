1.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,"this movie was seriously so funny and so much fun to watch. i cant believe it took me so long to get around to seeing it! honestly, if you're not on something already, it makes you feel like you are! i could just watch it over and over; everything was just so random it was brilliant!"
0.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,"A psychedelic waste pit of ugly UA animation, a song the only makes sense if you are on LSD, an bad acting."
1.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,"It's visuals may not be of the comprehension of some viewers (inluding me) but that can't remove the fact that Yellow Submarine is more than a musical, it's an authentic piece of art. Even many years after it's release, it has the same magic."
1.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,Endlessly inventive animation invigorates this tale of the Beatles saving a psychadelic fantasy land from a nasty horde of invaders. The images stagger the imagination and overall the film serves as the perfect complement to the Fab Four's late 60's material.
1.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,My favorite movie ever!
1.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,"""Yellow Submarine (1968)"" is one of the most imaginative and psychedelic animation films of all time, especially when you count the music of The Beatles."

1.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,I loved this movie. It really gives the impression that it would be better viewed when a bit out of it. But I enjoy randomness and do not mind the Beatles.

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,Wonderful film. I have seen it twice and look forward to watching it again. The sweet way that Charlie falls for Rose is something that only two wonderful actors can portray. The scene where Bogart imitates the hippos and makes her laugh is adorable. The wedding is unforgettable.

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"John Huston filmed his World War I epic on location, which was an unusual decision at the time, but the grittiness and festering of the jungle perfectly matches the griminess of our main characters, played by Bogart and Hepburn."

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,The first of a series of boy meets girl and they take on the world. Once again a classic movie with two of the greatest actors to ever live. Joe versus the Volcano might be said to be a take off of AQ. Very loosely. Same struggles different picture.

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"A very good film, staring Audrey Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart. It's a romance with lots of action and some comedy in it; it's set durring WWI in Africa as they take a small boat, the African Queen, down a dangerous river in order to destroy a gargantuous German ship."

A definite classic!"

1.0,from_russia_with_love,"+ The Platinum standard for 007... Very down to Earth & tense storyline with thrilling moments every which way... Red Grant is still imo the greatest Bond villain  - Perhaps too long of a run time... With its minimalist direction, there are a few lulls to grow accustomed to"

1.0,from_russia_with_love,"Corny, cliche, but down right hilarious. With some good fight scenes to boot."
1.0,iron_man,The one that started it all. Iron Man set the tone for what is now a juggernaut in Hollywood. RDJ throughout the series has the best character arc and we see how it all began right here. 5 Stars.

1.0,iron_man,"Re-watching the MCU movies, and I think this first one might end up being one of the best! I had forgotten some of Iron Man's rad origin story, but not how insanely charming Robert Downy Jr. is Tony Stark - smart, sexy & funny. The CG is still impressive a decade later too."

1.0,iron_man,Where it all began. Terrance Howard was pretty dumb to bail on the MCU over money. But in the end I like Cheadle better so it all worked out. Marvel knocked it out of the park with this one. I just wish we could have more Iron Man movies.

1.0,fistful_of_dollars,"The least of the trilogy: perhaps. A perfect movie: most definitely. Though it follows the plot of another favorite movie of mine, Yojimbo by Akira Kurosawa, to the letter, ""A Fistful of Dollars"" has enough stylistic flare to make it stand on its own. This is a perfect start to a perfect series."

1.0,fistful_of_dollars,"Love westerns. This is one of my favorites. Spaghetti westerns are a special breed, they're a hit or miss. Being the first, or one of the first, of it's kind, it is the king.

1.0,1000617-aliens,"Hard to find fault in this film, by far the strongest in the franchise. It's just another example of James Cameron being a master of sci fi action pictures. It's got a great storyline great cast and great visual effects. It's the one Alien film you can watch over and over."

1.0,1000617-aliens,"Filled with great performances, gorgeous direction, and exhilarating action, Aliens is still one of the greatest Sci-Fi films ever made."
1.0,1000617-aliens,I would love to see a new one of this caliber!!!!
1.0,1000617-aliens,A superior action sequel better than than the first.
1.0,1000617-aliens,My one comment on this movie is as follows... take down Gene Siskel's lackadaisical attempt at writing a review on this timeless masterpiece.
1.0,1000617-aliens,One of the greatest films of all time.
1.0,1000617-aliens,Awesome sci fi horror movie!
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Aliens is one of the rare sequels that is even better than the original. By taking everything such as the masterful execution of suspense and character development, Aliens transcends being just a horror thriller but also a great action and drama movie as well."
0.0,1000617-aliens,"This is a very hard movie to get through, reminded me a lot of Avatar. How can this be that big a drop in quality from the original."
1.0,1000617-aliens,A great sequel to a ground breaking film! Riply is the most bad ass chick to ever hit the movie screen and she does not even mean to be bad ass either. The alien is one of the most unique creatures ever created.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Better than the original. Filled with more action than the first and somehow builds on an even better atmospheric story, and still has the same amazing effects as it's predecessor. Well James Cameron, I will accept you for some movies, and this shall be one of the movies."
1.0,1000617-aliens,best overall of the series.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"James Cameron is my favorite director, and possibly the best director of the 20th century. The detail he puts in this movie goes without saying."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Without argue, Aliens has made itself a big name compared to the original and brings you to a whole new scene of the same xenomorph monsters we always loved before!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"This is an outstanding movie. Moving, action packed and fast paced."
1.0,1000617-aliens,One of the best films I have ever seen. Loved every second of it.
1.0,1000617-aliens,It's some of the same formula from the last movie but comes off fresh with a new cast of more fleshed out characters (except ripely). Debatably this is a better sequel but it's unfair to compare the two because they are different genres but they are both fantastic movies.
1.0,1000617-aliens,The rise of Bill Paxton.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Excellent movie. For it's time it did exceptionally well with effect. Aliens used no CGI effect, it was all puppets and costumes - genius"
1.0,1000617-aliens,One of the best sequels ever made and a sci-fi horror action classic
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Thrilling roller coaster of a film that has a little bit of everything...sci-fi, horror action, gore...you name it, it's got it all tied up in a nice, tight package. Great acting, wild effects and great direction help make this the true classic it's become."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Once again,the even better sequel Aliens,gives us what made its original great ,and adding more with its colonial marines,strong performances,action packed,with its non-forgettable quote ""Its game over man,game over!"",and the weapons make this sequel worth the while to watch."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"A full blown science fiction classic. It was as great (albeit starkly different) as the first and far better than the rest in the series. The atmospheric tension, and surprisingly good acting made this film a roller coaster ride of thrills, kills, and big black aliens."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Faster paced than the first, but just as good. ""Aliens"" is once again a superb entry in the genre."
0.0,1000617-aliens,-: that fucking little girl...opposite of plot driven story telling. Everything seems so predictable and unnatural.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Game over man, Game over"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"while Alien was a masterpiece of a horror/ sci-fi film, Aliens was a masterpiece of an action/ sci-fi film. easily the best action movie ever made, with an original story that has been duplicated many times *cough* Halo *cough*"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"While ""Alien"" is a fantastic Sci-Fi Horror film, ""Aliens"" is a fantastic Sci-Fi Action film with horror elements. It's well directed, superbly acted, and more memorable than the original. Oh, and the Colonial Marines, really awesome!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"American classic enough said, but really what else is their to say about Aliens"
1.0,1000617-aliens,James Cameron not only reinvented the scifi horror of Alien but turned it into a heart stopping military action film with some of the most lovable soldiers ever put to film.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"A sharp contrast to the original (a roller coaster ride of action and violence, yet still intense and frightening, capped off with a legendary performance by Sigourney Weaver."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Heartbreaking, thrilling and exhilarating. There has never been a move classic thriller/horror movie. It's not at all hard to get sucked up into it's madness."

1.0,1000617-aliens,"The greatest sequel ever made! May not be a horror film like the first one, but Cameron created a suspenseful, thrilling, and action packed alien film. Expanded the universe to a whole new level!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Similar to its counterpart in themes and plot but much more intense and gripping, Aliens combines the best parts of the horror and sci-fi genres to create an awe-inspiring action masterpiece, as well as utilising the considerable talents of Sigourney Weaver and James Cameron."

1.0,1000617-aliens,Amazing! With great special effects and exceptional acting. This is a great improvement over an outstanding preceder

1.0,1000617-aliens,Classic of our generation
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Truthfully, one of the best movies I've seen and arguably one of the best movies of its decade, while the killer performance Sigoueney Weaver blew me out of my socks, the plot development with the suspense mixed in, makes me say 5 stars!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Possibly the best movie ever made, in my opinion. For a movie from the 80's, this one had it all: actors, crew, effects, plot, action. Everything."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"The zenith of sci-fi films. Weaver eclipses her role once again, as Cameron takes the reigns in a more intense action directing with memorable moments and relatable characters."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Even better than the first, ""Aliens"" is just as creepy, but more intense and filled with memorable scenes, lines and tons of action."

1.0,1000617-aliens,"While not only scary, it's well written, perfectly action packed, phenomenally acted especially by Sigourney Weaver, and like it's predecessor, creative in terms of set design. Aliens stands very tall within the sci-fi film pantheon."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"In my all time top 5. Michael Biehn's ""Hicks"" character is right at the top of my all time favorite characters as well as performances. The movie holds up so well almost thirty years after it's release. Genius cinema."

1.0,1000617-aliens,I own this on DVD and on Blu-Ray in a four movie pack along with:* Alien (1979)* Alien3 (1992)* Alien Resurrection (1997)
1.0,1000617-aliens,This might be better than the first movie! :)
1.0,1000617-aliens,This movie is a great action movie. Classic. Love it! James Cameron's best work.
1.0,1000617-aliens,5/5 * An extremly effective action horror thriller that surpasses the original in some respects presenting the main lead as a horror iconic hero with visceral and emotional fury.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Aliens is the classic example of a great si-fi movie. This film is one that every Sci-Fi, James Cameron, or Alien fanatic should check out."

1.0,1000617-aliens,"I actually had never seen this until last night. It was PHENOMENAL. Alien was good....a good solid horror movie. But this movie was just amazing. Ripley is a strong female leader, but she can be maternal as well. And the story....just....freaking....wonderful."
1.0,1000617-aliens,Classic. Badass female character taking on monsters. Intense and entertaining. Loved it.
1.0,1000617-aliens,Aliens throws intense action sequences into the mix and still retains much of the terror and horror from it's predecessor and both are surprisingly blended together magnificently. Aliens is a great sequel and an equally great movie.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"As James Rolfe (the AVGN) said, James Cameron can go to the grave knowing he made two of the best action sequels ever in cinema, one of which is ""Aliens."""
0.0,1000617-aliens,"Another shitty shitty movie. The action scenes are boring. There is no suspense. The ""military are bad"" theme is old and tired and not explored in any nuanced way here. The climax is hilariously awful. AJDSKFJDS"

1.0,1000617-aliens,Best Sci-fi honor of all time.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"SIgourney. Ah, Sigourney. Sigourney, Sigourney, Sigourney."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"My second favorite movie EVER. Ripley is the Heroine every woman in movie/pop culture history (other then Princess Leia) wants to be. It's survival horror at it's grandest, it's just entertaining popcorn perfection."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Even better than the first, it's like the first was made just for this one. It's the action version of the first but also has just as many scares."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"A very different film than its predecessor, Aliens proves that taking a different road can sometimes be just what is fitting in a sequel"
1.0,1000617-aliens,Everything a sci-fi action movie should be.

1.0,1000617-aliens,"There are two kinds of people in the world; people who prefer the movie Alien to Aliens and people who prefer the movie Aliens to Alien. And you can't go wrong with that. Just add a lot of cool action and suspense, with a plural to make an awesome sequel."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Awesome movie. Very tense, very suspenseful, very action-packed, with an excellent performance from Weaver."
1.0,1000617-aliens,One James Cameron's best films and the best film in the alien saga Aliens is one of many sequels that is better than the first and the big difference is that this film is action packed.
1.0,1000617-aliens,One of my all time favorite movies! A must see for any horror fan!
1.0,1000617-aliens,By far the best of the Alien movies. Sigourney Weaver comes back from the first film with a powerful persona while still having a maternal sense about her when it comes to dealing with her crew and the little girl.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Next to Terminator 2, this just might be the best sequel ever made!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"New direction, huge amount of aliens coming at the same time, makes this movie great entertainment movie.And James' direction, strong script, and Sigourney's acting, this movie also succeeded to be great drama."

1.0,1000617-aliens,"a sequel that actually develops the ideas from the first movie and doesn't just try to copy it. Cameron has made a few good films, this remains his greatest."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"best action movie ever made, and awsome effects. and the directing is great. but the girl so annoying when she screams but I would be screaming to if there was a alien in front of me lol"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Whereas 'Alien' was one of the best horror films ever, 'Aliens' is one of the best action movies ever made. With a terrific lead heroine, a great cast of memorable characters, and some excellent effects/action sequences, this is easily one of the best sequels ever made."

1.0,1000617-aliens,Better than the first (Alien).
1.0,1000617-aliens,"I think people don't understand how much this movie influenced media now watching it 23 years after it released. It created the survival horror scenario seen in every movie and video game that game after it. Shear perfect tension, horror, and action. It is only bested by it's original."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"One of the best Sci-fi movies of all time! James Cameron as always turns the movies he directs into cinema gold. Everything and everyone that helped produce, star and create this movie deserves a full A+ rating. They dont make movies like this anymore!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,Hands down the BEST science-fiction action film of the 20th century. AMAZING VISUALS and TERRIFIC PERFORMANCES as well as CREEPY SUSPENSE MASTERY elevates James Cameron to the top of my (and I'm sure everybody else's) list of top notch directors.

1.0,1000617-aliens,"A sequel worthy of its predecessor, Aliens not only delivers the terrifying thrills of the first Alien but, with the help of director James Cameron, it becomes an existentially well-crafted action film with even grander visuals and even more memorable character performances."

0.0,1000617-aliens,"This is a bad movie notonly because it is too dark for me, but it also promotes stealth in space with the Sulaco. There is no stealth in space as guaranteed by the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics!"

1.0,1000617-aliens,"Few films deserve a five star rating, but this is one of them. It's visually stunning, fantastically written, graced with some awesome actors, extremely intense, and nails both the action side of the story and the emotional one (between Newt and Ripley)."

1.0,1000617-aliens,"Agree Agree Agree, This Movie Was Absolutly Badass"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"One of Cameron's best films, and a brilliant sequel to Alien, because it dared to do something different. i.e. Make a Vietnam film in space as opposed to the scary house style of the first. Ofcourse now it has been done to death, but Aliens stands the test of time."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Chilling and suspenseful, and doesn't rely too heavily on violence."
1.0,1000617-aliens,Great movie that keeps u at the edge of the seat.
1.0,1000617-aliens,Just as thrilling and incredible as the first.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"James Cameron writes and directs the sequel to Alien that has great action scenes, spectacular special effects, very memorable characters, and a amazing performance by Sigourney Weaver."
1.0,1000617-aliens,(Re-watched on DVD - 31 March 2013)
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Where the 1st 1 was more of a horror come thriller this one is more action come thriller...I have to agree with a lot of the comments on here that its very rare to see a sequal that is as good as or dare I say it , better than the 1st..."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"One my favorite movies of all time. Great action, believable characters plus Bill Paxton is funny."
1.0,1000617-aliens,Pretty intense hardcore sci fi. Starts out pretty slow but gets rolling fast. Lives up to its reputation as a a superior sequel.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Aliens isn't exactly a suspensful horror film like Alien, but it is a darn good science fiction-action film. It does everything a sequel is supposed to do and does it well."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"If you want to make a good sequal, always have more guns. Guns and action. Guns and blood. More of what you feared in the first movie is what makes a great 2nd movie. More action, more people to get killed and a bigger area. This is what Aliens had and its what made it better than the first."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"With amazing action sequences, brilliant effects work, and a strong, multi-dimensional lead character, 'Aliens' is action filmmaking at its finest."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"this movie surpasses the original alien, although alien is darker and scarier, aliens is faster paced, and has more action, and aliens"
1.0,1000617-aliens,Pretty much the best movie ever made. Ever.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"One of the best sequel of all time! James Cameron went deeper into alien mythology and delivers not only a good horror movie, but also a pure action movie. And when you see the Alien Queen you know one thing - you will get away from her (bitch)!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,Ripley jumps from a monster horror flick to a balls-out action movie with such a fluid transition you barely notice it happened. Cameron is right at home and at the top of his game.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"I actually have an old starlog magazine where the director talks about what scenes had to be cut from the story in the first movie and viola! they all ended up here. More action than suspense or horror, but still enjoy this movie."

1.0,rio_bravo,"Another one of my favorites. A nearly perfect western in my mind with John Wayne, Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson and a hilarious Walter Brennan. I could watch this a hundred times and still love it."
1.0,rio_bravo,best wayne film ever great all star cast
1.0,rio_bravo,"The movie is a great classic in its genre. But could someone, please, fix the movie year: this movie was released in 1959 (definitely not 1998)."
1.0,rio_bravo,"If you only see one Western ever, you might want to make it this one. The actors are all superb and the story, while simple, is compelling. In so many ways this is the model for so many Westerns that came after it (together with films like High Noon)."
1.0,rio_bravo,The best Western from the classic times by far! My favorite John Wayne western of all time.
1.0,rio_bravo,It could be the best western ever made.
1.0,rio_bravo,"The best western I have seen, the romantic interaction was brilliantly executed."

1.0,rio_bravo,One of the best westerns of all time!
1.0,rio_bravo,classic hawks john wayne vehicle
1.0,rio_bravo,This is one of my favorite westerns. Not only John Wayne and Dean Martin star in it but so dose Angie Dickinson. Its very similar to El Dardo thoe. But I gusse it was just so amazing the first time the had to make it agine.
1.0,rio_bravo,the cowboy flick to end all cowboy flicks.dean martin is drunk. john wayne is a stand up guy. ricky nelson sings. chyea.
0.0,rio_bravo,"John Wayne should've realized that when you make a film in response to another movie that the movie you're making has to be better than the film you're responding to. Horribly acted, horribly directed, horribly written. 1 star! High Noon is a masterpiece!!!"
1.0,rio_bravo,love this movie it is my husband fav movie it also grew on me
1.0,rio_bravo,"Rio Bravo is probably one of the best Westerns ever made. Wayne is so cool,but its Dean Martin as the drunk who shines for me."
1.0,rio_bravo,i love this movie with guys like John Wayne and Ricky Nelson i also like Dean Martin in this one he plays a good drunk but thats not the only reason i like this movie.Its a really good movie with a great cast in it.
1.0,rio_bravo,"What a cast, a great story and the songs are memorable...one of my top 10"
1.0,rio_bravo,"The most watchable Western of all time. A great buddy movie, a great shoot-em up, a great character study. Howard Hawks puts together the greatest Western/action team of all time with Wayne, Martin, Nelson, Dickinson, and Brennan."
1.0,rio_bravo,John Wayne underplays his character and lets Dean Martin take over in an often overlooked roll. The cast of characters are steadfast western favorites with just enough levity and seriousness to make this a fantastic move beginning to end.
1.0,rio_bravo,the duke kickin but and letting some woman tell him what he feel's

1.0,rio_bravo,"Angie Dickenson was the only negative in this movie. She was stiff and uninteresting, then again, maybe I was jealous??? Also, I was watching this movie at the very moment Ricky Nelson's plane was crashing, resulting in his death. :-("
1.0,rio_bravo,Cowboys + shootouts + singing + Classic western characters in non-classic situations = Howard Hawks' best movie

1.0,rio_bravo,"Wow, Dean Martin nearly steals this one from the Duke. This film is both one of Hawks's and Wayne's best, one of my all-time favorites. I just watched it for the first time in several years and it turns out that it's even better than I remember it, comparable in quality to John Ford's best."

1.0,rio_bravo,This movie is not too different from all of the other 4 billion classic western films. I don't know why I like it so much. It is extremely well written and does have very likable characters.
1.0,rio_bravo,Every potential US immigrant should be forced to watch this western and then quizzed afterward
1.0,rio_bravo,"This is John Wayne's finest movie that has the Duk,e in his best role: a sheriff. The story is greatly told and fits the age rather well. Not many other Western films come close to this one's calm but dangerous nature"
1.0,rio_bravo,"A great story, especially when you realize it really is Dude's story, one of redemption...also great script. The new DVD, plus extras is excellant. Inspiration for the original Assault on Precint 13...by Carpenter."
1.0,rio_bravo,"Great, great John Wayne western. The Duke is his usual lovable self, Walter Brennan is hilarious, and Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson sing a song or two together. The shootout at the end is great fun."

1.0,rio_bravo,"My favorite Western. That's not to say it's the best, but for me it's the one I always come back to. Also, it's pretty much required viewing for any fan of John Carpenter. This is where so many of his movies came from."

1.0,rio_bravo,"En sheriff, en alkis och en krympling star upp mot en ra ranchagare, vars bror haktats misstankt for mord. Howard Hawks berattar om myterna, friheten och karleken i vilda vastern pa ett alldeles betagande satt. Hans film innehaller ju allt!"

1.0,rio_bravo,Y 'a rien de mieux au monde. Promis.
1.0,rio_bravo,"It's actually a romantic film about the way men should be, or want to be, and how they are as represented by the 3 characters. Or is it just cowboy gun-fights. I dunno. Brilliant. Chills up the spine when the mexican band start playing."
1.0,rio_bravo,I love this movie. Dean Martin was awesome. Angie Dickinson is fantastic. John Wayne thats really all you have to say.

1.0,rio_bravo,One of the best westerns.

1.0,rio_bravo,"John Wayne was a great comedic actor, and Dino gives a fantastic performance. The anti-High Noon, it's a relaxed, long, light-hearted character-driven picture. See is just for the duet between Dino and Ricky Nelson."
1.0,rio_bravo,i really like this film.
1.0,rio_bravo,"""I guess we made him talk after all. """
1.0,rio_bravo,"This relaxed, character driven western may be Howard Hawk's most personal film. Much more about friendship and professional camaraderie than action or violence. Classic Hollywood filmmaking at it's best."

1.0,rio_bravo,"I waver back and forth on which is better version of this tale (this one or ""El Dorado"") but since this one came first, it gets the slight nod."

1.0,rio_bravo,"Howard Hawks had a brain, and he wasn't afraid to use it. The entire case (almost) gives incredible performances, with Dean Martin and Angie Dickinson almost stealing the show from Wayne. It earns the definition of ""classic""."
1.0,rio_bravo,A true masterpiece. Walter Brenan is great. My favourite western.

1.0,rio_bravo,"Ricky Nelson Was Hottttt. So was, in a way, Dean Martin"
1.0,rio_bravo,"In its simplicity it becomes one of the great westerns because it has a single vision, a particular point of view, and expresses it perfectly."
1.0,rio_bravo,this is like my favorite western ever!!!!!!!
1.0,rio_bravo,Uh who wouldn't love this movie.. Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson singing. That just warms a girl's heart. That and I absolutely love anything John Wayne plays in.
1.0,rio_bravo,A superbly-crafted western built on characters rather than action or landscapes. The Duke's presence leads the film but the rest of the cast are strong enough that he doesn't overshadow them.

1.0,rio_bravo,the duke is the foookin daddy
1.0,rio_bravo,The movie that inspired so many film makers. It is perfect. Walter Brennan portrays the best character that ever existed in any film....the one and only stumpy.

1.0,rio_bravo,"The quintessential cowboy movie, I've seen a lot and they don't get any better than this. Even the 'lamest'(?)part of the movie where Ricky and Deano do a song is damn awesome. Walter Brennan, Johnny Wayne. Say NO MORE!!!"
1.0,rio_bravo,"Seriously everything about this film is perfect. Before, I had heard people call it slow-paced. What a load of bull! The time just floats by. Before, I thought John Ford was the master of the Wester, but after watching this I seriously needed to reconsider."

1.0,rio_bravo,Such crisp directing from Howard Hawks.

1.0,rio_bravo,2 or 3 of john wayne!
1.0,rio_bravo,"I have seen Rio Bravo more often than any other film, and it never gets old. Hawks, Wayne and the rest are at the top of their game."
1.0,rio_bravo,"With the steely competence of his adventure films, and the usual upending of the same typical of his comedies, it might be Hawks' richest, most complete film. Certainly Wayne has never been better--and he's easily outdone by Martin and Dickinson."
1.0,rio_bravo,John Wanye and Dean Martin...Think thats says enough! I watched this with my grandad and is the total reason why I love it. [Apart from Wayne and Martin]
1.0,rio_bravo,The best western ever. Period. No discussion.

1.0,paths_of_glory,M-F8.5[Stanley Kubrick]
1.0,paths_of_glory,Kubrick at is early powerful best. The ultimate absurdity of war movie. Beautifully shot. Great performances
1.0,paths_of_glory,"After Full Metal Jacket, this is the second greatest war film ever made. Kubrick has made another masterpiece."
1.0,paths_of_glory,Great awesome movie! You get to see Kubrick's famous tracking shots and how he started doing them in this movie.
1.0,paths_of_glory,Amazingly structured timeless anti-war movie by Kubrick. It has numerous classic scenes that have some splendor in them.
1.0,paths_of_glory,"A realistic look at World War 1, Paths of Glory manages to be faithful of it's source material with Kirk Douglas's Amazing Performance"
1.0,paths_of_glory,"Easily Kubrick's most accessible film, and possibly his best."
1.0,paths_of_glory,This is the first of Kubrick's films where he seems to emerge as the director he will become. The long tracking shots and precise camera moves create the impression of soldiers trapped in an infernal machine whose main function is to destroy them. One of his best films.
1.0,paths_of_glory,One of Kubrick's best.
1.0,paths_of_glory,An excellent movie with great acting!
1.0,paths_of_glory,This is one of the best Stanly Kubricks movies although it is his early movie. It is just great.
1.0,paths_of_glory,"One of the greatest films ever - after many viewings its still packs all its punch. Intense, riveting, troubling,"
1.0,paths_of_glory,"Kubrick's best depiction of the brutal and dehumanizing face of war, it not only offers excellent performances, an exquisite cinematography and an intensely absorbing dialogue, but ends with an especially beautiful (and thought-provoking) last scene."
1.0,paths_of_glory,An emotional impactful film lead by superb acting from Kirk Douglas and everyone else. Kubrick does a good job at directing the thrilling suspense and the dramatic suspense with the same amount of precision and delicacy.
1.0,paths_of_glory,"It's a little weird to see a Kubrick film that's this short and isn't coy about it's themes or plot . . . Still, that shouldn't suggest that it falls short of greatness as it's one of his best films"

1.0,paths_of_glory,"Coronel Dax, personagem de Kirk Douglas, pode facilmente se encaixar como um dos mais importantes personagens da filmografia de Kubrick.

1.0,paths_of_glory,One of the best war movies ever.
1.0,paths_of_glory,My favorite Stanley Kubrick film (followed closely by Doctor Strangelove) but also one of my favorite ANTI WAR movies. I do not think any movie has captured the absurdity and insanity of Warfare better than this 1957 movie that still is still relevant today.
1.0,paths_of_glory,This film plus A Very Long Engagement pretty much sum up WW1 from the French perspective. It is hard to believe that this film is over 50 years old because it has held up so well. Just a great film.

Kubrickin ohjaus on mestarillista, kasikirjoitus on vakeva ja Kirk Douglas loistaa paaosassa myos sivuosista loytyy nappisuorituksia. Todella hyva sotadraama kaikinpuolin."

1.0,paths_of_glory,"An excellent film that was expertly written, acted and directed. Calling it ""anti-war"" is unfair in my opinion, a label it gets because t doesn't glorify battle or the people who wage it. Really it's a film railing against imperiousness and callous authoritarianism."
1.0,paths_of_glory,Kubrick's first real classic.
1.0,paths_of_glory,It's just as relevant today as it was 50 years ago and 50 years from now the same thing will probably be said. This should be required viewing for every human being!

1.0,paths_of_glory,A wonderful considering the time of the film. Kubrick proves that he was a master film maker and teller of timeless tales. The acting was controlled rather than overdone like so many other movies in the era.
1.0,paths_of_glory,downright amazing you must watch this film

1.0,paths_of_glory,"Probably the greatest ""war"" movie ever made. I don't agree it is anti-war, although the book was. The character of Col. Dax really captures the sense of duty and also sense of justice, but never questions the war and war itself."

1.0,right_stuff,I have to maintain an even strain to watch this movie--Tom Wolfe got it right and Sam Shepard is vintage Yeager!
1.0,right_stuff,"Why this didn't win best picture is beyond me. It was nominated. This describes the kind of character, strength and tenacity the first astronauts had before we went to the moon. Ed Harris plays a very convincing John Glenn. I'm greatful thye take some time to show the wives of these brave brethren."

1.0,right_stuff,Wow. Americans make a film that celebrates the US of A while at the same time poking some good natured fun at it all. One cannot pay the makers a greater compliment than to say they captured Tom Wolfe on celluloid. Oh and Levon Helm makes a great narrator.
1.0,right_stuff,Very epic and a lot of fun too!
1.0,right_stuff,Fascinating true story. Excellent performances and dialogue. Beautiful looking film. Reminds me a bit of Kubrick. One of those films I can't stop watching once I've started.

1.0,right_stuff,An underrated gem. Kaufman on top form.
1.0,right_stuff,"A phenomenal movie, and it's actually better than the book. Any fan of film, Tom Wolfe, or the Space Program ought to see this.

1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"""Robin Hood"" is a fun movie with great swordplay, score, and sets. Great performances from Errol Flynn, Claude Rains and Basil Rathbone. This is the definitive, swashbuckling, action/adventure movie that makes you wish you could see in Technicolor."

1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"I have fond memories of watching this one as a child. It's a fun, clean movie the whole family can enjoy, but it will probably stire the imaginations of little boys the most! Great sword fighting, and it's in color!"
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"Wonderful swashbuckling romp. Anyone who can seriously say, ""I don't like this movie', is showing that something is missing in their heart= if not their soul."

1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,A swashbuckling movie worthy of the title character.
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"A classic. From Max Steiner's score, Flynn's joyous exuberance as Robin to Curtiz brilliance at staging...the whole package!! Excellent!!"
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"After so many years of re-watching this film, I can still find something new (just noticed that when Robin shoots a guard in the back, the arrow snuffs out a candle; coolll). This film is simply letter-perfect in every scene."

1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"A thrilling and lively version of the Robin Hood tale, and possibly the quintessential Errol Flynn film. The sets and melodramatic script are so hokey as to be charming. Rathbone is absolutely over the top. Huge fun to watch."
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,One of my all-time favorites! The actors! The music! The nifty tights!
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,Fantastic. Swashbuckling at its best.
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,Was anyone ever younger and more full of life than Errol Flynn onscreen? Doesn't Olivia de Havilland's Maid Marian melt your heart? Doesn't Claude Rains define malevolence? And the musical score deserves equal billing with the lead actors!

1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"No one swashshed a buckle like Errol and he swashes big time in this fantastic adventure movie.The Technicolour,the music and the set design all awesome...Gisbourne's humiliation in the forest...Tuck's first encounter with Hood...Hood escaping the feast...the sword fight on the stairs."
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,My favorite Robin Hood by far!
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,Errol Flynn was the best Robin Hood ever! No amount of remakes or re-imaginings can change that. The word swashbuckler was invented for this movie. They just don't make them like this anymore.
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,The Perfect popcron movie in every way
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"Despite being tacky by 21st century standards, it is a great movie to watch in my opinion. I just love Olivia de Havilland. Errol Flynn is simply dashing and debonare, well-suited for Robin Hood. And Melville Cooper is a perfect bumbler as the Sheriff of Nottingham."
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"Ah, childhood memories. And not only that. Man, this movie gets more awesome every time I watch it!"
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"This movie is actually terrible, but it is so bad I loved it."

1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"Unabashed, unrepentant, unassuming old-fashioned light-hearted entertainment of the absolutely highest caliber. Seriously, they don't make movies like this anymore, and I'm not talking about the technicolor. Point of reference: A New Hope is this in space."
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,Simply a classic! They don't make em' like this anymore.
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"I watched this a second time last night. This time, on DVD. What a fun glorious film. Probably the best cinematic adaptation of the Robin Hood legend."
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,Cine del de antes!!!! del mero mero esto es una peli de aventuras de verdad verdad
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"Exuberant romance and chivalry.These were the glorious days of real Hollywood,glamorous still but somehow,the most amazing adventures were made at that time.Sharp,abundant,Flynn and de Havilland are superb."
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,The ultimate Korngold score -- written before they shot a frame. Arguably the ultimate Flynn too. Claude Rains and Basil Rathbone shine. Alan Hale is hearty.
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"When someone mentions Robin Hood I automatically think of Errol Flynn. This is by far the best Robin Hood Movie ever made. The completeness of the story is unparalled and the actors are A list:  Errol Flynn, Claude Rains, Basil Rathbone, Alan Hale, and the ever-beautiful Olivia De Havilland"
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"Puts the swash in swashbuckler. Perhaps the perfect adventure film. Old school where bad guys are transparent and the Maid Marion is helpless.

1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"A wonderful movie. Errol Flynn was the perfect Robin Hood, Olivia de Havilland the perfect Marian, and together they can't be beat. A bit of trivia: the horse that Marian rode in Sherwood Forest was none other than the famous Trigger, who would later be owned by Roy Rogers!"
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,Definite classic. Errol Flynn was the perfect Robin Hood.

1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,This is how action-adventure should be. The swordfight between Flynn and Rathbone is still one of the best in cinema history.
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"Un sc??nario magnifique, un d??cor en carton, tout un imaginaire marqu?? par ce film, un chef d'??uvre de cin??ma bourr?? de faux raccords et de nuit am??ricaine, bref de gros trucages comme on aime.

1.0,1001280-assault_on_precinct_13,"Carpenter at his best; right up there with Halloween and The Fog. The story of a gang's siege on a police station is suspenseful and tautly directed.

1.0,searchers,Brilliant movie! Beautifully shot with great performance by John Wayne.
1.0,searchers,The best western ever made... there will be no arguments.
1.0,searchers,"In my opinion, the best work of both John Wayne and John Ford. The scenery alone makes it worth watching. John Wayne's most powerful role; how the Duke was not even nominated for Best Actor baffles me."
1.0,searchers,"That'll be the day when anyone is justified in criticising The Duke! This is not only a great western (and in my mind the best western ever made), but it's also one of the greatest movies ever made. The colour and expanse of Monument Valley surely influenced Kubrick when he made 2001."
1.0,searchers,this is a film that was filmed when films were films.

1.0,searchers,"Best western I've seen, with John Ford's direction at its best. If you're a John Wayne fan, be prepared for the darkest, best performance of his career. Young Jeffrey Hunter and Natalie Wood, who both died young, are terrific. And what's a John Wayne/John Ford movie without Ward Bond?"
1.0,searchers,I love how John Wayne just walks off into the sunset after 5 years of chasing after his niece. I suspect that he was going to take a nap.
1.0,searchers,"Beautiful. A seemingly simple story that is actually pretty complex and tinged with sadness, regret and, of course, redemption. The greatest Western ever made and my favorite John Wayne movie. The end always get me."

1.0,1019544-spartacus,One of essential of epic roman movies. Kirk Douglas is astonishing so unforgetable as the iconic hero and liberator.
1.0,1019544-spartacus,"Kubrick's most underrated film, (which is curiously one of the best) presents us with the great vision of the director of the history of Spartacus.The performance of Kirk Douglas along with the handling of the story make this film a jewel of epic cinema, to the caliber of Ben-Hur or Quo-Vadis."
1.0,1019544-spartacus,Another classic from Mr. Kubrick.

1.0,1019544-spartacus,"A Kirk Douglas vanity project and plagued by production woes, this ambitious cinematic feat turns out to be stirring of epic proportions with no small aid from the writing by Dalton Trumbo, the sweeping score by Alex North and its cinematographic grandeur."
1.0,1019544-spartacus,A perfect film. Love every second of it!
1.0,1019544-spartacus,"Excellent addition to Kubricks catalog, and sword and sandals alike. Great acting, great screenplay, and epic soundtrack"

1.0,1019544-spartacus,"It's odd witnessing Kubrickean technique with the swords-and-sandals epic genre, but Spartacus is one graceful portrayal of leadership and defiance accompanied by the depth of Roman politics."

1.0,1019544-spartacus,"Okay, so slave girls probably didn't look like Jean Simmons stepping out of a beauty salon, but this remains an incredible film. Triumphant and tragic, hopeful and cautionary. If you don't get teary eyed when Simmons shows the crucified Spartacus his son at the end, you may not be human."
1.0,1019544-spartacus,Kirk Duglass classic
1.0,1019544-spartacus,"It is surprising that hardly anyone realizes that this is a Kubrick film. It does have his style, it is just hard to pick up because the film was very much like the epics released at the time (I.E. El Cid, Ben-Hur, The Ten Commandments)."

1.0,sicario_2015,"With expertly crafted, albeit, minimal set pieces, fantastically nuanced performances, and a tight script handled by a more than capable director, Sicario shows the dark underbelly of not only the Cartel, but the government with flying colors. This is the best thriller of the year!5/5 stars"
0.0,sicario_2015,This movie is very boring for someone who likes fast action and rapid changing scenes. This movie is very slow. The movie is more about the characters themselves than the actual story line. I don't recommend this movie if you like big action movies.

1.0,sicario_2015,One of the better movies I've seen in awhile! Loved it. Suspenseful and thought some great acting.
0.0,sicario_2015,"Dull, no sense of suspense, just a series of depressing events. The protagonist is written as a complete loser. She is not good at anything and loses over and over again and is a loser at the end. In addition, she is written as dumb. Who wants to watch 2 hours of that? Terrible."
1.0,sicario_2015,Solid movie and writing. Can't recommend this movie enough. Same director that's helming the new Blade Runner.

0.0,sicario_2015,I have no idea why everybody loves and raves about this movie so much. I thought it was absolutely boring and ask the characters are overly acted pompous jack-asses. The whole time I was waiting for the movie to end.
1.0,sicario_2015,"A unique, slow burn, war on drugs film that is a masterclass of directing and cinematography. Featuring a breakout performance from Emily Blunt and one of the best performances Benicio Del Toro has ever given us. This is film is not quite what you expect and that makes it all the more better."
0.0,sicario_2015,"I'm the only one in my family that thought this was not a good movie. The film opened up with a lots of flash in attempt to draw you in, but after that the movie spiraled downward quickly. I lquit watching after and hour or so... It was one of the most boring movies I've seen in a long time."
1.0,sicario_2015,"Intense, adrenaline-rush action movie I've seen so far."
1.0,sicario_2015,One of those must-watch once and also Never-watch-again films. The first 40 minutes or so are prolly the best made storytelling I've seen in years. Great performances. Love Emily Blunt even more. Depressing though. Watch it if you're in the mood to see a good heavy thriller

1.0,sicario_2015,"Yet another great film from Denis Villeneuve with a ""No Country For Old Men"" type of feel."
0.0,sicario_2015,Del Toro and others make this movie barely watchable. The Emily Blunt Character is pointless. If we found out she was a ghost in the last scene of the movie it would be believable.
1.0,sicario_2015,Benicio del Toro is an amazing actor. This movie was such a favorite of mine that I ordered the DVD.

1.0,sicario_2015,Fantastic from start to finish.
1.0,sicario_2015,"Sicario is a disturbing, realistic depiction of the ongoing war between the U.S. and the Mexican drug cartels that should not be forgotten. Benicio Del Toro gives an Oscar-worthy performance alongside Emily Blunt and Josh Brolin, who both give excellent performances as well."
1.0,sicario_2015,Incredible direction and story telling. Loved it
0.0,sicario_2015,"I am really only giving this half a star because I have trouble with the stupidity and lack of planning carried out during the first couple missions, and the lack of common sense and naiveness of what is supposed to be a federal agent is astounding...

1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,Best War movie ever. This was one time the best picture really was the best picture.

Great Classic Film.

1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,An excellent movie of good olden days
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,I was skeptical because I don't usually like war movies. But this film was a masterpiece. The last 30 minutes rank among some of the most exciting moments I've ever seen in a film. It has all the emotion and thought of a Greek tragedy. Bravo.

1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,"Alec Guinness as obsessively principled Colonel Nicholson, the role revels in its moral ambiguity. The battle of wills between Nicholson and Saito, played by Sessue Hayakawa, propels the film to its closing line (""Madness... Madness"")"

1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,One of the best movies ever made
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,"Another classic Sir David Lean epic. Besides brilliant script-writing about the cultural differences between parties, it celebrated the matter of 'principles' and a man's determination to uphold it. Nobility and graciousness of the trully remarkable Sir Alec Guinness shall never be forgotten!"
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,My dad told me that they built a replica of the bridge for kids to play on at the drive-in near where he grew up. It was built by the children of English POWs and then blown up to prevent model trains from traversing it.
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,"Too brilliant for a short review. Interesting take on how one perceives the psychology of Guinness' character Nicholson but more importantly, the way the climax was handled - just epic. Lean really dished us a masterpiece."
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,"This movie made me deeply think and question the validity of principles. I have never thought so much about a movie afterward. Extremely long, but the length is necessary for the payoff at the end."

1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,"An epic for all epics, this film will have you sweating by the time it's over. An incredible display of psychological fortitude from Guiness as he endures an unimaginable test of character. One of the coolest endings to a movie ever."

1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,one of my favourite movies...Alec Guinness in his best interpretation...
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,Brilliant film and well worth a visit to see the real bridge and while your there sitting down with your ice cold coke think about those prisoners who worked everyday for up to 12 hours.
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,"What a great classic!, It's a truly gem!.-"
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,A classic in my book. Fairly true to the book with some glaring exceptions buta deserved winner of many awards.
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,"Amazing blockbuster from 1957, hasn't aged a bit. Holden and Hawkins excellent but it's Alec Guinness who really pulls it out...he's magnificent. Jack Hildyard's cinematography is sumptuous, shot in Sri Lanka."

1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,Best film ever. Just like Too Late the Hero but this film shows a dedication to the wrong cause where apathy was warranted not bravure and pride.
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,"a very story of leadership, obsession and conflict."
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,Alec Guinness before he was Obi-Wan Kenobi. Definitely one of my favorite WWII movies of all time.

1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,"I would say that David Lean couldn't top ""The Bridge on the River Kwai,"" but I'd be ignoring that other brilliant epic he made in 1962. I should probably see ""Doctor Zhivago,"" though."

1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,Another great Holden film...
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,I don't know how I didn't see this movie. The ending fits perfectly with the theme of the whole movie and the bridge/building of the bridge becomes a tie which binds the characters together no matter the circumstance.  All for one and one for all?
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,"One of the finest moments in any film ever made is when Alec Guiness finally realizes what he's done. Good god, what an amazing moment!"

1.0,bourne_ultimatum,"One of the best action flicks I've ever seen. From the moment the movie starts until it's jolting end, you are on the ride of your life. Damon, who I would have never imagined as an Action Star, has solidified his place among one of the greats"

1.0,bourne_ultimatum,Great finale to series!
1.0,bourne_ultimatum,Outstanding. I was very impressed once again just how entertaining these bourne films are. Solid movie that will always keep the viewer interested in Matt Damon's character. All due respect to Jeremy Renner taking over the role but I will miss Matt Damon as Jason Bourne.

1.0,goldfinger,"Perhaps the Best Bond film of all, oozing sex appeal and flaunting cool Conney's Bond takes things to the maximum with great villains, sidekicks, gadgetry and the undoubtable best Bond song in Shirley Bassey's Goldfinger. A classic Bond adventure and a real Joy!"
1.0,goldfinger,Best Bond movie ever.
1.0,goldfinger,"What can't you say about this movie? It has everything, and is wonderfully cheesy and camp. This is Bond when Bond was allowed to be Bond, before he had to go on some kind of existentialist quest to save the world, and instead, could fight evil gold-obsessed bad guys."
1.0,goldfinger,The most iconic film of the Connery era and beyond.
1.0,goldfinger,Classic Bond at its best. Bond's classic witticisms really begin here. Memorable villains and Bond girls. The Aston Martin DB5 is introduced with its many gadgets in use here. A truly amazing battle sequence at Fort Knox provides a brilliant and remarkable finale to this most famous of Bond films.
1.0,goldfinger,"""Do you expect me to talk?""""No, Mr Bond, I expect you to die""Epic, quintessential Bond."
1.0,goldfinger,"Top notch film. Exciting plot full of twists, super cool villains(Oddjob anyone?), awesome gadgets, and the birth of Bond's most famous line ever."
1.0,goldfinger,"Pure James Bond at its best. Classic in every sence of the word. Campy, violent, women, gadgets, and all. Simply put, the best movie in the entire franchise."
1.0,goldfinger,People say Jaws was the blue print for the modern blockbuster but I have to disagree and say it's this movie. For an older film it feels like a modern day spy film.

0.0,goldfinger,Crock of Bond Shite.

1.0,goldfinger,Great film. One of the best Bond films.

1.0,goldfinger,Such a classic. Everything that made James Bond fun to watch is here in this movie.
1.0,goldfinger,either this or the new casino royale movie are the best james bond movies ever made
1.0,goldfinger,"Beginning with the first pre-credit Bond mission, including the first gadget packed car and ending with yet another woman in a parachute; this is the Bond film that delivers everything. Nobody does it better and never more so than Goldfinger."
1.0,goldfinger,"Definitely one of my only favorites in the Bond franchise that would match up to most fans' favorites (meaning not all my favorite Bond flicks are just Sean Connery movies).... But holy shit, Goldfinger rocks"
1.0,goldfinger,The Best one ever made followed closely behind by Casino Royale
0.0,goldfinger,"This is another old Bond with a ridiculous plot (fly over Fort Knox spraying knock out gas and then break into it? lol), but I think this is more like a Bond film than the first two. Still, quite badly made and not really much fun."
1.0,goldfinger,"This is perfection in Bond filmmaking. It doesn't get any better than this - the action, the plot, the girls and Bond himself make this one the best Bond outing in my opinion. So many things are right about this one, just go see it right now. It's ridiculous. I love it."

1.0,goldfinger,One of the best Bond films
1.0,goldfinger,"The definitive Bond movie, it gets everything right. The girls, the gadgets, the cars, the action, the story, villains, cast, music, title song and most of all it is entertaining. If you like this any other Bond pales in comparison in terms of getting everything right."
1.0,goldfinger,"Of all the 22 official Bond movies, Goldfinger is the definitive benchmark for what a perfect Bond movie should be. Memorable villains, cool gadgets, beautiful women, and a perfectly characterized secret agent to deal with it all."
