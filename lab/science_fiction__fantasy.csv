1.0,the_martian,Very. Entertaining and smart

1.0,the_martian,"THIS MOVIE WAS SO AWESOME I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT!!! There wasn't a part of it I didn't like. There's no strong language though, I don't know why that's in the rating. You haven't lived until you've seen The Martian."
1.0,the_martian,"Martian takes a funny, yet thrilling look at the perils of survival"
0.0,the_martian,"Although the visuals are well done, there is nothing surprising about this movie. You can tell early on how it's going to end, because it's so obviously fitting the common American triumph trope. I felt no suspense, and though acted well the main character has little depth. Meh."
0.0,the_martian,I enjoyed this movie but I hated the use of sarcastic humor and too much music which ruined the film for me. I like space movies to be serious. I would recommend it for kids but there was some really unnecessary profanity in the film. A dumb Hollywood movie.
1.0,the_martian,"Loved this movie, very funny"
1.0,the_martian,An absolutely great movie. It is so great that it is re-watchable
0.0,the_martian,"I don't understand. It's trying to be funny, right? Just no."
1.0,the_martian,This is one of the best science fiction films I've seen in the last 5-10 years.
1.0,the_martian,"This is, without a doubt, Ridley Scott's best film. Funny yet very dramatic and suspenseful. Other than The Force Awakens, this is the best Sci-Fi movie of 2015."
1.0,the_martian,"Funny, smart, and beautiful."
1.0,the_martian,una actuaciÃ³n impecable de Matt Damon. sabe de todo.

1.0,the_martian,Best movie I've ever seen!
1.0,the_martian,"This movie had Drama, Comdia, Action and Suspense. Matt Damon performance as Mark Watney was absolutely perfect and supporting actors had a good performances also this movie deserves a Oscar."

1.0,the_martian,You have to see this one!
0.0,the_martian,Fun..Cliche'd..and too optimistic to a fault. High entertainment value...but lacks that surrealism that would make the movie a bit more compelling.
1.0,the_martian,"Well, it is one good movie, although some places are unreasonable. Like surviving a tornado that's thousands of Newtons, that it is inpossible to have a tornado on Mars because of the thin atmosphere"
1.0,the_martian,A brilliant film with incredible performances from Matt Damon and co.
1.0,the_martian,Fantastic movie. What sci-fi should be. Not since Contact have i seen such a smart sci-fi.
1.0,the_martian,"The Martian has made history, a movie that is supposed to be about a serious topic has been turned into a comedy quote show put on Matt Damon. The movie still offers the very realism of landing on Mars."

0.0,the_martian,"Pretty Boring, not really into space adventure, but I LOVED Gravity! Don't understand why this one was not that great. Boring, and way too much talking! I also found WEAK humor in this movie! I did like Matt Damon in the movie though...but other than that. Not much. REALLY OVERRATED!"
1.0,the_martian,"Matt Damon solo performance, He is Stunning and of course The Mars set is stunning too !"
1.0,the_martian,$11 and really solid.
1.0,the_martian,"The movie Scienced the shit out of Mars.This is what I'm talking about when I say ""science-fiction should use real science not."""
1.0,the_martian,This movie is epic. I have now seen it about 20 times and it gets better all the time. It has everything. Brilliant
1.0,the_martian,"Science nerds, ftw!!!"
1.0,the_martian,Matt Damon at his best with the same movie theme - being rescued. I love all the scientific/space jargon. It makes space more relatable to common folks like us.
0.0,the_martian,Laughable. The ability to suspend disbelief vanishes immediately and never returns. The acting is awful and the final scene where he's caught by the captain with a red ribbon is the ultimate disbelief. I'm sorry that 92% of you convinced me to order it up.
0.0,the_martian,Piece of crap. Matt Deamon is about as much fun as a woodlouse eating cornflake haha. Send me away from space!!
1.0,the_martian,"Easily the movie of 2015. Matt Damon is at his best here, the plot is great, the acting is very solid, and also, a very engaging film. Two thumbs up."
1.0,the_martian,This spiritual successor to Gravity is an overdue return to form for Ridley Scott.
1.0,the_martian,"Brilliant film. Fresh, different, and faithful to the book; a man trapped and forced to survive using science and logic as opposed to strength and violence. It's clever, surprisingly humorous and positive, and has a really nice tone to it."

1.0,forbidden_planet,50s scifi at its best

1.0,her,5/5. I never thought I would be so emotionally invested in a love story between a man and a computer. Her is an emotional roller coaster and one of the best films of 2013.
1.0,her,What a beautiful movie. Unique. I've never seen anything like it and i loved the themes that her explores. All the characters were great and there were some amazing performances from Phoenix and Amy Adams.

0.0,her,"This was a sick, weird, boring piece of crap. A real yawner."

1.0,her,I loved this. It displayed how difficult it is to have a relationship when we really don't know who we are. The evolving AI was done so well and leaves us all questioning our own evolution. Well done - highly recommended for those that enjoy thinking about realities.
1.0,her,"A great take on artificial intelligence. A men falls in love with his operating system...if you think about it, not so far fetched.... A very layered, emotional and warm movie. A love poem starring just one person. Or two?"
1.0,her,Freakin' amazing. Not many films are like this one. Love story for modern society and a tale about how we become more disconnected from society with the advancement of technology and our fear to interact and love each other!

0.0,her,This was a waste of $2 from Redbox.
1.0,her,Absolutely beautiful.
1.0,her,Graceful and stylish; Jonze's sharp commentary about connectivity manages to turn its science fiction set-up into awareness about isolation. Her is a modern jewel that only promises to get better with time.
1.0,her,"Great show. Watched on AA137 DFW-HKG Aug 24, 2014. Joaquin Phoenix is great, and whichever German actress played the voice if the OS is seriously sexy, at least as far as her voice is concerned."

1.0,her,Quietly stylish and thought provoking
1.0,her,one of the finest love stories on screen
1.0,her,I love this movie so much. I think this movie is similar to Lars and the real girl but better. This movie is touching and the soundtrack really fits well with the movie.
1.0,her,"This is one of my favorite films, and I know that audiences will either think it's silly or think it's beautiful. I'll say this. Give it thought that someone out there is willing to love something enough to have hope that it will love them back.Perfect film, smart, wonderful, loved every moment."
1.0,her,Absolutely loved this. An incredible examination of what it truly means to be in love. I give it the highest recommendation.
1.0,solaris_1976,M-F-O9.2[Andrei Tarkovsky]
1.0,solaris_1976,"A dauntingly complex and emotionally powerful study of grief and human emotion. While it may be quite different from Lem's book, Solaris still shines as perhaps Tarkovski's best movie.One of the greatest movies of all time."
1.0,solaris_1976,I'm still lost in space.
1.0,solaris_1976,"No, it's not 2001. But this is one hell of a movie. Starts out very slow, but when our protagonist arrives on the space station, things become tense. Tarkovsky reaches a level of profundity nearly unprecedented."
0.0,solaris_1976,Good luck staying awake.
1.0,solaris_1976,"Great Soviet sci-fi movie, one of the few actually. The philosophical tale clearly made as a response to Kubrick's 2001."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Majestical, beautiful and cerebral with dialogue that's uber-smart and poetical. I later learn this was Tarkovsky's LEAST favourite film. What a treat I am in for watching the rest of his ouevre."
1.0,solaris_1976,Such a Beautiful masterpiece filled with lost and grief. Easily my favorite Tarkovsky film.
1.0,solaris_1976,Una de mis películas favoritas de toda la vida...

0.0,solaris_1976,"Interesting concept, painfully dull."
1.0,solaris_1976,Director Andrei Tarkovsky utilizes the medium of science-fiction to pose profound questions about mankind and the meaning of life. The result is a chilling and thoughtful motion picture.
1.0,solaris_1976,"Painfully slow as it may be, Solyaris uses this meditative pace to deliver a hypnotic and innovative film experience."
1.0,solaris_1976,"A masterful exploration of loss and guilt that leaves Hollywood attempts in the dust, an argument could be made that 'Solaris' surpasses even Kubrick's '2001' in the science fiction genre. A close contender for my favourite film of all time."
1.0,solaris_1976,Mindbending! It will trick your mind till the very end
1.0,solaris_1976,"Tarkovsky's Solaris is a mysterious, ambient film with philosophy and psychology to spare. The sets are elaborate and the final moments encapsulate a sense of disbelief and consciousness at the same time. A truly excellent sci-fi (if it can be called that)."
1.0,solaris_1976,"This review is for the Russian, 1972, version...An absolutely beautiful film - intellectually and aesthetically - SOME holes in the storytelling, but mostly due to the nature of the surrealism of the narrative. Highly recommended; and, one of my new favorites..."
1.0,solaris_1976,Andrei Tarkovsky's brilliant reworking of the Stanislaw Lem novel about cosmonauts faced with a strange alien intelligence that communicates using recreations of people from their memories. Fascinating film; eerily introspective and compelling.
1.0,solaris_1976,"""Don't turn a scientific problem into a common love story""."
1.0,solaris_1976,This is my favourite movie of all time. But please can the date be corrected in RT? It is 1972 not 1976.
1.0,solaris_1976,"La respuesta Rusa a 2001 de Kubrick....si, tan viajado como suena."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Really a masterpiece, with outstanding photography."
1.0,solaris_1976,"What it is to be human. What it is to be in love. What it is to be stuck having to choose between the two. Memories, reflections, regrets, infinity. Mind blowing, and absolutely hypnotic."
1.0,solaris_1976,"This haunting reply to Kubrick's ""2001"" perhaps surpasses it."
1.0,solaris_1976,Better than '2001'? Quite possibly.
1.0,solaris_1976,This is not a film but a visual poem about love and humanity.
1.0,solaris_1976,"The greatest science fiction film I have ever seen, and one of my all-time top 3. In fact, Ran is its only competition for my favorite movie."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Quanto mais tentamos procurar vida além do nosso planeta, mais nos perguntamos sobre a nossa existência."
1.0,solaris_1976,What can I say? It is visually incredible. The themes leave you thinking for days. The cinematography and the editing are daunting. This film is irresistible to me on so many levels. Truly one of the greatest Science Fiction films of all time.
1.0,solaris_1976,"It's a lot more punishing than most sci-fi film, but that's because Tarkovsky creates such rigid characters to match his settings."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Absolutely incredible. Upon watching this for the first time, it instantly became my new favorite film of all time."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Beautiful, quite possibly the best science fiction film ever."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Watch this along with Stalker, another masterpiece. Questions the nature of consciousness and reality in a thoughtful, intelligent way. Better by far than the remake. This film can be difficult to locate."
1.0,solaris_1976,"I saw this in the theatre when I was little. I had no idea what was going on, but I loved it anyways. By the time I saw it again, in my late 20s, I had read the book several times, and found the film even better than I remembered. (And THEN I found out that Tarkovsky's other movies are even better!)"
1.0,solaris_1976,brilliant! absolutely mesmerizing!
0.0,solaris_1976,hated this movie. Russian stuff is SO SLOW. Minutes 5-15 or so were the only interesting part of the whole film.
0.0,solaris_1976,Appallingly slow paced. Not a good sign when you could easily have cut the first 50 minutes of the film. Semi-experimental in style. Muddled in thematic & philosophical intents. Not a good adaptation of what is a great novel.
1.0,solaris_1976,A Sy Fy master piece and a reflection about human nature...
1.0,solaris_1976,"brilliant, unforgetable,"
1.0,solaris_1976,Whilst others may talk of Star Wars or Bladerunner (taking nothing away from them) this movie is stunning in its revelation that essentially all stories are about a man and his inner universe..simply perfect

1.0,solaris_1976,Possibly the best Sci-Fi movie ever made.

1.0,solaris_1976,Mindblowing and artistic in every sense.
1.0,solaris_1976,"My favorite foreign film, this sci-fi movie almost becomes a horror, showing the pains of not being able to let go of the ones you love. Visually it is a treat, especialy in the opening scene. It really makes you think, especially after the fantastic ending."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Despite not quite a faithful adaptation of Stanislaw Lem`s novel, Tarkovsky`s film remains a sci-fi masterpiece!"
1.0,solaris_1976,A low key philosophical sci-fi masterpiece.

1.0,solaris_1976,"It's late and there's nothing I can say after a single viewing that will do justice to how this film affected me, so I'll only say that I'm ashamed that it's taken me this long to fill this particular gaping hole in the realm of my film viewing experience."
1.0,solaris_1976,"This movie is haunting. Not because it's very scary, but there's something about the atmosphere. And also the Ocean. It's a very slow moving film, but it really pulled me in. This one's going to take many viewings."
1.0,solaris_1976,A classic. Must see for movie-lovers. This film is so much bigger than sci-fi.
1.0,solaris_1976,Don't waste your time on the US remake with George Clooney This is the version you should see.
1.0,solaris_1976,A mediative and engaging film. Completely unlike any other movie I have seen.
1.0,solaris_1976,Awesome achingly beautiful film

1.0,solaris_1976,Tarkovsky not for everyone.. but this good
1.0,solaris_1976,An excellent psychodrama. The best science fiction film I have seen in years.
1.0,solaris_1976,The outer reaches of within.
1.0,solaris_1976,This is very philosophy science fiction. Earth for Solaris makes person's mind an embodiment.Why did he have wanted to make such a movie? Steven Soderbergh directed an American adaptation of Solaris in 2002. But ending is different.
1.0,solaris_1976,"Beautiful meditation on love and the divine. When asked to choose between Camus's hopeless happiness and Dostoevsky's depressing hope, Tarkovsky keeps you guessing. Of course, it's difficult to analyze the film in words, and I think that's the point."
1.0,solaris_1976,"I laughed , I cried , It was a masterpiece"
1.0,solaris_1976,Solaris is a masterpiece. It's ravishingly beautiful and charged with a real poignancy.

1.0,solaris_1976,"Brilliant and incredible. A beautiful, compelling science-fiction epic that has yet to be matched...one of the greatest of all time."
1.0,solaris_1976,January 2010 - It is alwasy hard to explain poetry and how it affects us. The images and the words in Solaris are of the same nature. You don't need a logic or straight story but you feel it and you cannot ignore its attraction.
1.0,solaris_1976,"Mesmerizing cinematography, symbolism and a timeless feel cement this film amongst best in the science fiction genre. Tarkovskyâ??s shots in space are just as graceful as his panning shots of the Earthly beauty. The film commanded my full attention from the first frame."

1.0,solaris_1976,Andrei Tarkovsky is simply one of the greatest directors of all time.
1.0,solaris_1976,It's my favorite sci fi movie. Intense in it's use of emotions AND philosophical insight. For a near 3 hour movie it flows beautifully and it describes human nature better than any other sci fi movie can.
1.0,solaris_1976,"Stanislaw Lem's philosophical meditation on ""inner space"" in ""outer space"", brought to the screen by Tarkovsky. It's a long slow but the performance's are so good and some of the imagery staggering so that once accustomed to it's slow pacing it has a hypnotic hold."

1.0,solaris_1976,"Es una de las mejores películas jamás hechas. No es sólo la ""respuesta rusa"" a 2001... es una obra de arte igual de interesante a la novela de Lem. El final del filme es diferente al del libro y ambos son geniales."

0.0,solaris_1976,allmost as boring as the cloony remake.

1.0,solaris_1976,"Tarkovsky captures the ineffable. Certain moments approach a cinematic apotheosis in terms of psychological depth as well as technical mastery. His command of the medium here is still without parallel today, almost forty years later."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Loaded with beautiful shots. A contemplative, thought-provoking film that poses many probing existentialist queries."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Subtle, beautiful, evocative, haunting... definitely ranks among the top 10 in my vast Sci-Fi movie collection. Not for everyone, mind you - no Lucas-esque space battles here - but very rewarding for those with patience and a questioning mind."
1.0,solaris_1976,Just watched this a second time and blew my mind. One of the greatest and thoughtful sci-fi films.
1.0,solaris_1976,A surreal treat from the USSR. Especially the driving scene in Tokyo.
1.0,solaris_1976,My favourite movie of all time. Never tire of this chilling and moody masterpiece of modern Cinema. Tarkovsky's finest hour (though he would argue with me if he were still alive!)
1.0,solaris_1976,"Fuck people who don't like Tarkovsky, fuck everyone who calls his films tedious and, most importantly, fuck the remake of this movie. There, I vented."
1.0,solaris_1976,Una inquietante respuesta a la odisea de Kubrick. El final es memorable.
1.0,solaris_1976,"Despreciada por los crÃ­ticos de Tarkokski *que la consideran una pelÃ­cula menor dentro de su filmografÃ­a, Solaris me parece una pelÃ­cula bellÃ­sima, una muy digna adaptaciÃ³n del libro de Stanislaw Lem."
1.0,solaris_1976,"It's not the size that matters, it's the motion of the ocean..."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Strap yourself in for some exquisite and intelligent and mature film making. Some hate its languid pace, but for me it captures the essence of what the film is all about - subtle exploration of inner space, rather than the usual sterile plot or action driven movie. Unforgettable classic.."
1.0,solaris_1976,Beautiful and stylish! Fucking LONG.
1.0,solaris_1976,"I like the way that the story has little drama but makes you feel uneasy watching it, where the idea of having your past, your stilted thoughts return fascinating. Yet, this was one of the most hardest films for me to watch and my least favourite by Tarkovsky."
1.0,solaris_1976,"yes, this is a long, slow film. but in my opinion, every minute of it is masterful. would easily be in my top 5 if not for the fact that all tarkovsky films are near perfect: choosing my favorite is like choosing a favorite child....its morally wrong."
1.0,solaris_1976,Way better than the remake. An enthralling Sci-fi journey with a psychological twist. Very surreal camera work.
1.0,solaris_1976,"This movie, although very slow and not a real sci-fi movie like we are used to know, is superb. The ""crazy"" talks in a space-can with rooms llike an old caste. The incredible love story between a real and a ""dream"""
1.0,solaris_1976,"Encountering ""The Unknown"" one has to face a fifth colony - his soul...Outstanding movie, quite outstanding!!!"

1.0,solaris_1976,Excellent plot. Outstanding photography.
1.0,solaris_1976,A slow and somber dissection of the human condition of loneliness in a very off put and obscure manner. It's a very frightening movie because it's so out there yet it hits you regardless with what Tarkovsky is trying to say.
1.0,solaris_1976,one of the best movies I have see in my life
1.0,solaris_1976,"""Solaris"" is considered the Soviet response to Kubrick's ""2001"", and is in many ways a better film. Many science fiction stories open with a mystery and conclude with an answer. ""Solaris"" only leaves us with more questions, but provides a new way of thinking about issues that we don't understand."

1.0,solaris_1976,"A trip inside of the soul, and what it means to have a memory of love in space and time. It also presents the future as cira 1972 Tokyo roadways! Great, great imagery, if not Tarkovsky's very best."
1.0,solaris_1976,"A science fiction love story psychodrama, beautiful hypnotic film."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Waa-wa-wi-wa, whatta movie!"
1.0,solaris_1976,"It's sooooooooooooooo long. There are serious periods of languid shots and no dialogue and then when they do it's all in Russian. Made me cry like a baby, though. Repeatedly!"
1.0,solaris_1976,This is great! Slow at times but beautiful. Doesn't resemble Noir like the silly remake. I think this film raises far more question and even contains a political text about current Russia. More later...

1.0,solaris_1976,"The original Solaris (not the Clooney remake) is the only sci-fi film I've seen that approaches the profoundity of 2001. The effects are so poor they are laughable, yet the strange story and its characters had me in their grips very quickly."
1.0,solaris_1976,MASTERPIECE......i have only used that word for three other films but the second this film was over there were a variety of questions in my mind......This is what great films do to you...a vast journey into humanity....through the eyes of Kris Kelvin we come to understand our humanity..
1.0,solaris_1976,Georges Klounoff is great in this movie.

1.0,solaris_1976,"A perfect representation of a solitary future... Tarkovsky built a station, a philosophy and an ideal, all without a single solid rocket booster."
1.0,solaris_1976,A sci-fi film less about the uncharted reaches of outer space than those within us all.
1.0,solaris_1976,"It´s a Tarko. Not really a sci-fi movie, but a journey to the human soul. Love it to death."

1.0,solaris_1976,very good film but hard to watch get inside your head but that what it's all about...:-)
1.0,solaris_1976,We know the ocean is the brain... Deal with that!I commented on the 2002 remake by mistake somewhere else. That is an average quality photocopy of this terrific film
1.0,solaris_1976,"Confounding, frustrating, baffling, and utterly powerful. That final shot is brilliant."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Slow and stark, perhaps overly, but stylish and profound. Phantasy turns against itself."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Absolutely brilliant: beautiful, moving, horrifying, and thought provoking. Tarkovsky's film is one of the true masterpieces of science fiction as it examines grief, human identity, love, and the powers that both make us human as well as tear us apart."
1.0,solaris_1976,This is one of the greatest science-fiction films ever created.
1.0,solaris_1976,"Excellent! A long movie, at 2 hours 50 minutes, but worth every minute. One of the >BEST< Sci-Fi movies ever--a beautiful, poetic film contrasting reality and our inner desires. Don't even consider the 2002 remake--in my opinion."
1.0,solaris_1976,One of the best movies about love
1.0,solaris_1976,I love the Tarkhofski's one.
1.0,solaris_1976,"While I enjoyed the American version well enough, I easily prefer this one. While the American one focused on love, this focused on what makes someone human, and the result is a film which is much more complex and compelling."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Brilliant, deeply philosophical, and from the Russian/Soviet perspective. Not counting the ridiculously long driving scene early in the movie, its nearly flawless."
1.0,solaris_1976,Tarkovskys best picture. Long and slow but never boring. Top 10 movies of all time.

1.0,solaris_1976,"Don't bother seeing the Americanised mainstream version of this cult Tarkovsky classic.Visually stunning and mentally stunning... hypnotic, oceanic, influential and by far quirky!"
1.0,solaris_1976,Tarkovsky's best... He's arguably the only good thing to come out of Russia.
1.0,solaris_1976,"Tarkovsky is a genius, and this is why."
1.0,solaris_1976,a slow-paced examination of what it means to be humani miss sci-fi like this
1.0,solaris_1976,"Slowly paced, but every second on screen is not wasted. It's not slow for slowness sake, but Tarkovsky forces you to be introspective, to think about what you are seeing and what it might mean to you. The ending, of course, is brilliant."
1.0,solaris_1976,a wonderful exploratory film that shines in its visionary direction and luminous acing.
1.0,solaris_1976,Strange haunting film classic. A must for every film buff
1.0,solaris_1976,"At times, this can be the slowest film you'll ever sit through. And yet, few films have ever managed to keep me hypnotized enough to be unable to pull away. Tarkovsky's directing here is beautiful, and befitting of the psychological depths here."
1.0,solaris_1976,The Russian counterpart to 2001. More philosophy in films please...
1.0,solaris_1976,my favorit film and book
1.0,solaris_1976,The best sci-fi movie ever because of the metaphysical exploration : What are the things you'll do different if you can ? What is your deepest dream ? your deepest need ?
1.0,solaris_1976,"A thoughtful and compelling science fiction drama in which exploration of the unknown turns out to be exploration of the self. It's slow, challenging, but hypnotic. In my humble opinion, the best science fiction film of all time."
1.0,solaris_1976,All I can say is why did it take me so long to see this. Tarkovsky captures my heart and head
1.0,solaris_1976,"It takes a while to get going and moves slowly once it does, but it's Tarkovsky; that's his thing. Stick with it, though, and it becomes a brilliant, shattering meditation on incarnation."
1.0,solaris_1976,Didn't 'really' get it until I owned it and could take my time with it. Absolutely love it
1.0,solaris_1976,Absolutely stunning!
1.0,solaris_1976,This film is very strange. Sometimes it may be one the slowest film you have ever seen... but it is one of the most fascinating as well.
1.0,solaris_1976,this is a deep meditation into your being. the ambience is superb and delivered strange feeling. the highway scene is amazingly strange.
1.0,solaris_1976,This movie is fascinating. It really makes you think. I couldn't take my eyes off it. You probably have to like stuff like ambient music and be awake enough to pay attention (it's long but I wouldn't cut a thing.)

1.0,solaris_1976,"Absolutely brilliant in every way. Meditative, haunting, and mystical; this film extends itself to the limits of human consciousness and the deceptive empiricism we like to call 'science.' Just brilliant."
1.0,solaris_1976,Tarkovsky's Solaris rules!
1.0,solaris_1976,"Based on the haunting novel by Stanislaw Lem, this film captures almost perfectly the mood and mystery of the book -- a rarity in sf. A conscious planet reifies our deepest, most painful memories -- are we mad, or do we have the chance to remake a failed past? No easy answers."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Liked this one better than the american version. Also don't try to read the English translation of the book, its lost way too much in translation."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Forget the re-done this is the real thing. A philosphical movie about life, guilt and human relations. Not easy to to to you but just plain brilliant."

1.0,solaris_1976,"A great movie, seen it a copule of day ago and never was disappointed. You don`t really expect visual effect of this kind of level from the 1972 film. But the main thing is ofcourse is how the actors play, how the make think about why are they doing it in the ways they do, great film."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Great thought provoking movie but the ending is just so out there, it confuses more than resolves things. Better than the Clooney remake in most respects."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Forget about the re-make, this is the version to see. The drama's more effective and the visuals are cooler."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Solaris 2002 est très bien aussi, mais je veux pas comparer ici. Si vous aimez les films, lisez le livre certains passages mon donnez froid dans le dos, si si. stanislas Lem nous a quitté en 2006."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Amazing film. Yes, it's slow and methodical, but Tarkovsky is at his best here."

1.0,solaris_1976,Russian cinematography at its best
1.0,solaris_1976,"One of the greatest science fiction films of all time, stylistically beautiful and incredibly thought-provoking, this original version (later somewhat remade by Soderburgh) has the powerfully philisophical dialog that the remake lacks - a signature of Tarkovsky and his Russian foundation."
1.0,solaris_1976,This is like a surreal travel into the human mind. It is clearly not a movie for everyone. Heavy weight film.

1.0,kubo_and_the_two_strings_2016,"While this is a ""family film,"" the basic themes are adult - community, family, death, grief, mourning, and memory.

1.0,1010678-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,"Every bit an icon as it is a staple in science-fiction cinema, Invasion fits an entire story of political and fear-driven commentary within a short amount of time. This is a film that proves that you can accomplish much in just over an hour given you have the right thinkers behind it."
0.0,1010678-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,"The most over-rated science fiction movie ever. I give it an A+ for the idea, but an F for the execution. Just drags on and on and on. Really bad movie."

1.0,1010678-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,Absolutely THE BEST Science Fiction film of the 1950s. Need I say more? And it came true! Everyone in the world HAS been taken over by pod people. Why else would they watch Big Brother?
1.0,1010678-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,"Incursion puissante dans le delire paranoiaque du protagoniste. L'histoire nous emporte dans un puissant crescendo d'angoisse, menant au denouement finale qui donne au film le titre de film culte."

1.0,1010678-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,"This is an example of a 50s SF film done right. The pace never eases when it comes to escaping the grasp of those pod-people. Also, the fact that it's a metaphor for America's fear in the Cold War makes it the better popcorn flick that it is."

1.0,1010678-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,Intense suspense and fear without relying upon the crutch of elaborate special effects. Reflects a skill in directing is which is only occassionally seen in the horror genre. My vote for best horror film of all time. The remakes have been poor efforts.

1.0,1010678-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,Origianal is sometimes best. Superb.
1.0,1010678-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,Saw it ages ago .. And I can't stop watching it. Like 1984 with aliens and a perfect portrait of political paranoia . Plus all the philosophical stuff you can just get out of it if you think a little.

1.0,1010678-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,Classic allegorical 1950s sci-fi piece whose ideas and themes haven't dated at all. Story about people being replaced by emotionless duplicates still provides thrills and chills. Even the studio-enforced happy(ish) ending can't spoil it.

1.0,1010678-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,"This is classic sci-fi. I have to put this down with the 1978 version, both have their own 'twists' which add their own flavour - but this was the one that started all the remakes.

1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"The very best of the b/w space movies, most of which are ""B"" at best. This one was transforming screen-writing for its time ... an alien that looked like us, and was actually friendly. We're the ones who were the aggressors out of fear."

1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,A great film with a nice moral in a terrifying tone of ultimatum. It`s one of the greatest Sci-Fi films ever made. It`s original plot gives us the kicks and the giant robot Gort gives the film the most originality.

1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"After watching this, I'm afraid to watch the remake. This is not so much because the original scared me (it is creepy though) and I think the new one will be scarier. I just don't want to see this great movie butchered. This is truly a great movie that deserves its status as a classic."
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"A first rate film from start to finish; skip the remake, the original is where it's at! :D"
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,Love the original and the story is so dark.
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"Not cheezy at all, and very interesting. This movie was perfect for the cold war, and the message still means a lot today. The character of Klaatu was my favorite as he was reasonable, logical, understanding and all he wanted to do was help even when the humans shot him. (twice.)"

1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"I love this movie, despite the fact that at no point in the film did the world actually stand still. Perhaps in the 50's, an alien stopping all cars for an hour to prove a point was the equivalent to the world actually coming to a stop."

1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"Much better than the remake. A film that gets people in touch with a higher truth. That the human race's survival means thinking in larger terms; thinking that we're more alike than different. It envokes the lyrics of ""Imagine"" by John Lennon."
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,This is classic stuff. Keanu Reeves is no Michael Rennie!
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"i love this movie, and compared to todays movies that most of wiich are recorded for a person with the attention span of a 3 year old hyper active child in a cocaine factory, i thought it was very fast, and for the mystery that was left at the end, it just adds to the suspense."
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,By far one of my favourite movies. Simple message the whole world really needs.... shame it may never happen.
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"""74% uninterested"" is proof-positive that George Harrison was right; the world really is doomed."
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"An excellent piece of classic cinema during a time of widespread fear across the globe.

1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"1000% better than the 2008 version. Sure, it's b/w and from 1951 ""studio technology"", but TRUST me...this is pretty much my fav movie ever, and I was appalled @ the ""remake""! If it ain't broke, don't fix it! This original 1951 version is CLASSIC, and for a reason!"
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"This has some really good acting to it. There was plenty of passion, fear, curiosity, and tension... not to mention hope. The new one has a few down-sides to it and was abit dissappointed."

1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"This version is so much better than the new one. The robot could have been 100 feet tall like the one in the new one, but who am I to decide?"
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,A perfect movie which deserves multiple viewings. Rennie is just right as Klaatu who visits planet Earth to deliver an important message affecting the human existence. Some of the special effects are dated but still an intelligent entry in the sci-fi generation of the '50s.

1.0,terminator,One of the best and well know sci-fi movies ever.
1.0,terminator,In top 10 films all time.
1.0,terminator,"Iconic. I would pay good money to see Arnie as the villain again, and no money at all to see him pregnant/twinned with an afterbirth/baby-sitting John Connor/you name it. Arnie is an emotionless Cyborg, I refuse to believe anything else!"

1.0,terminator,Supremely well paced action film that manages to be smart as well as exciting. A seminal work and prototype for the modern merging of action and science fiction. James Cameron appears to have taken many cues of Ridley's Alien.

1.0,terminator,The most overlooked movie of all time.  The most underrated love story of all time.  The plot for this movie was written in a van.  The movie's exposition is delivered crouched in a 1980's Chevy.  Yet it is still one the most original story-lines ever conceived.  My all time personal favorite movie.

1.0,ex_machina,"Between a creator and creation possessing free will. Ava asked how does it feel to create something that hates you while at the end of the movie, the creator is right. An interesting plot twist to ponder."

1.0,ex_machina,"Well this film really surprised me. Watching it while having no idea about what the movie is really about just turned out to be one of the best sci-fi/thrillers made in a long time.Alex Garland, writer of ""28 Days Later"" and ""Sunshine"", makes one hell of a directorial debut!"
1.0,ex_machina,"Me gustó mucho el film, creo que la combinación de un buen guión y una fuerte interpretación de los actores dio a la película un sentido de dirección inmejorable, creando un ambiente tenso y un desenlace poco predecible y satisfactorio."

1.0,ex_machina,"Haunting, complex, intriguing and deeply poetic: Ex Machina is the definition of a cinematic treat. One of the five best films of 2015."
1.0,ex_machina,"The best Sci-Fi film in the last few years. It asks questions of humanity, personality, and moral justice."
1.0,ex_machina,"A phenomenal film, Alicia Vikander (Ava) was mesmerizing."
1.0,ex_machina,"This film has stuck with me. Not for all the reasons I've read, but because it shows how incredibly vulnerable we can make ourselves."
1.0,ex_machina,What a crazy awesome movie.

1.0,ex_machina,"Not a sequel, not a prequel, not a reboot... Finally a movie with a (rather) original plot, and a good one too. So they can still make new movies in Hollywood ? Good news.Witty, pretty... Not the most entertaining, but smart and pretty smooth."
1.0,ex_machina,Excellent film. Ditto any other good review
1.0,ex_machina,"The idea of the AI itself is just way bombastic! Thrilling, dark yet mysterious storyline with a terrific flow of plot. Consider this as one of the best film in 2015!(But here comes a question, how do the AI recharge herself after getting into the city??)"
1.0,ex_machina,"Despite its graphic content, I can't remember the last time I found this level of entertainment, philosophy, suspense, and terror in a film."

1.0,ex_machina,Everything about this movie is a masterpiece.
1.0,ex_machina,"I found myself going over this over and over in my mind. While watching I thought maybe Ava wasn't an AI at all, but a doppelgänger of Nathan, and Nathan would turn out to be the AI."
1.0,ex_machina,"Easily one of the best movies of 2015, the claustrophobic feel of Ex Machina allows the movie to be creative with its runtime, and its mature, complicated psychological themes make it especially memorable."
1.0,ex_machina,"By all means a great film. A movie built on and thriving with ideas, and some nice performances add to the flavor. By all means, see this film."

0.0,captain_america_civil_war,Abysmal movie. This movie should have been called Captain America: Internal Struggle as this was definitly not the epic Civil War story. This movie would have been fine had they not called it something it definitly was not.
1.0,captain_america_civil_war,By far my favourite film

1.0,captain_america_civil_war,Favorite out of the whole Captain America trilogy.
1.0,captain_america_civil_war,"I need six stars. Loved it.Loved the real tension between characters and worldviews. A persuasive way of helping children (and adults) realize that our heroes aren't one-dimensional people - and even heroes can have genuine differences of opinion about ""right"" choices."
0.0,captain_america_civil_war,One of those movies where I just can't understand how anyone was able to like it. I even thought the graphics were bad for this one. A lot of computer battles that just looked bad.

1.0,captain_america_civil_war,This movie brings a lot of background for the next avenger movie. I like how it developed two new characters Spider-Man and Black Panther
0.0,captain_america_civil_war,"Crammed with countless characters that the movie can't seem to make you care about, 'Civil War' is a dull, stakeless, emotionless action-fest that refuses to push the boundaries of the superhero franchise."
0.0,captain_america_civil_war,Dreadful in every respect.
1.0,captain_america_civil_war,"I really enjoyed everything about this movie, it talks about all the characters so well (although I would have gone deeper on Black Widow). It was incredible to see new Spider-Man portrayed by Tom Holland. I am really looking forward yo watching Infinity War."

1.0,captain_america_civil_war,Captain America is a bad ass and he's played so well by Evans. I'm not a huge Iron Man fan and I find Batman boring but I've always been a sucker for Captain America and Superman- real superheroes if you ask me.
1.0,captain_america_civil_war,I personally do not agree with this rating. I think it deserves at least a 97% or more. This is so far my favorite movie. I am so excited to see Avengers: Infinity War. Ahh I'm screaming I'm so excited!

1.0,captain_america_civil_war,"Hero against hero not only shows us a different take on a Marvel film, but also gives us a little taste of what's to come for Infinity War. New Spider-Man, Tom Holland proves to the audience that he's perfect for the role of 15 year old Spidey."

1.0,wall_e,I liked this movie alot
1.0,wall_e,Everything about this movie is perfect.
1.0,wall_e,"Pixar has done it again. Incredible, brilliant, touching, funny, and full of adventure. Also a bit of a look into what our future may be like should we continue to litter our planet..."
1.0,wall_e,luv roborts fallng in luv
1.0,wall_e,This is one of the best love stories. Superb story and animation. Loved it.
1.0,wall_e,best first 30 mins of film in a long time
1.0,wall_e,"Not my favorite, but certainly the best of Pixar. There is a difference."
1.0,wall_e,I challenge anyone to watch this and not fall for Wall·e!
1.0,wall_e,"Wall-E is beautifully made and it manages to tell a love story without any dialogue at all (something which Up did the next year to the tenth degree). It's brilliant, but what keeps it from being my favorite is the perhaps overbearing themes throughout."
1.0,wall_e,Best animated film ever!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,wall_e,"Designed to tug at your heartstrings, but done with such nuanced flair, I wish I could give it a bonus star."
1.0,wall_e,A film you can never get tired of.
1.0,wall_e,It has a GREAT message and the animation is a fantastic example of how far Disney has come.
1.0,wall_e,"If you can get past the obvious politicalism and ignore the poor fat people jokes, this one is hillarious! Oh, and be sure to catch the short ""Presto"" before Wall-e starts. Get that popcorn and get seated!!"
1.0,wall_e,"Another memorable Disney-Pixar gem. A simple and well made science fiction movie that kids and adults will enjoy, along with the important message of caring for the environment, the earth, our home."
1.0,wall_e,"Tell me a movie that in the first 30 mins., that has no dialog but conveys so much within that time frame with that kind of CGI beauty?"
0.0,wall_e,Movie is borning and lame
1.0,wall_e,"In addition to its undeniable sweetness, there is ecological commentary embedded in Wall-E that succeeds without preaching at its audience."
1.0,wall_e,Such a...cute movie. I would definatly recommend it!
1.0,wall_e,"still such a wonderful/beautilful film,stunning cgi & good story with funny scenes & charactersone of the best pixar films so far, a masterpiece"
1.0,wall_e,"The movie was full of heart and it made us all turn the other sheeck, stop and think about the world for a moment."
1.0,wall_e,Eva and Wall-e's love is truly touching. Teaches kids to stay close to good friends and you can accomplish anythimg
1.0,wall_e,"Had been looking forward to this film since I saw the first trailer and was not disappointed. Once again, Pixar delivers a great love story between two endearing characters and also (though unintentionally) delivers an environmental message of what we humans are doing to our home."
1.0,wall_e,Really good n funny movie
1.0,wall_e,I cried at the brilliant emotion portrayed in this superb romance from Pixar.
1.0,wall_e,The perfect animated movie
1.0,wall_e,Another great example of what Disneys Pixar has to offer. A very moving movie even though there was no dialog. Its almost as if I could feel what Wall-E was feeling.
1.0,wall_e,The primary use of body language in this film makes it unique. The ptomaine displays it's boldness in a good light.
1.0,wall_e,"Arguably Pixar's masterpiece and inarguably one of the greatest films in cinema history, ""WALL-E"" is supremely intelligent, touching, and nostalgic, with characters and themes more poignant than most live-action pictures could only dream of possessing."
1.0,wall_e,This movie is wonderful.
1.0,wall_e,"It's very hard to pick a favorite Pixar Movie, but for me Wall-e comes very very close. The way the story is told makes you care so much for the main character's journey, which combined with mind Blowing visuals and sounds, results in a Amazing Movie! Thanks again Pixar"
1.0,wall_e,This has got to be one of the greatest movies I have ever seen in my entire life.
1.0,wall_e,"Wall-E is a maturely conceived production that largely succeeds emotionally, visually, and intelligently."
1.0,wall_e,"One of Pixar's greatest achievments thus far, and one of the most original and inspiring (though political/social undertones not subtle) animated films of all times. Simplistic, and simply a masterpiece."
1.0,wall_e,Another masterpiece of Pixar....
1.0,wall_e,One of Disney's best.

1.0,wall_e,"great movie, reminds me if a little johnny 5 haha"
1.0,wall_e,Wall-e got all the things needed to be a blockbuster....the love story here is better than twilight in 4 movies compressed together.......and Mr. Louis Proyect don't review movies if u don't know anything about them....k.....and its not a request...its an order
1.0,wall_e,"Convertido en un clásico de Pixar gracias a su emotividad fuerte, escenografía e imágenes bellísimas y potentes, y una premisa simplemente perfecta. Es toda una oda al género de la animación y de la misma manera, a la humanidad."
1.0,wall_e,"Pixar had done toys, bugs, cars, monsters and superheroes. They'd already done a film set underwater. So, a film set in space with robots as main characters was an obvious choice, right? Well, they pulled it off spectacularly. It's one of my favourite films of all time."
1.0,wall_e,I love it great childrens movie
1.0,wall_e,"A love story of robots Wall-E and Eve attempting to save Earth over a plant, how simple for Pixar to make another grand slam. Also has a cool message in which you must not rely entirely on robotics to prolong your human life. It'll make you fat."
1.0,wall_e,One of my favorite animated movies. Such an interesting plot. And it looks amazing.
1.0,wall_e,Very sweet love story. A Disney film set in space. Love it!
1.0,wall_e,One of the best animated movies of all time. Pure Pixar Perfection.

1.0,wall_e,"Clever, funny, and original. This film is perfect."
1.0,wall_e,Brilliant - my favourite Pixar. Feels like the most grown up film they've done to date.
1.0,wall_e,Just a perfect movie
1.0,wall_e,Probably my most favorite animation film ever. I was a sucker for a lonely humble robot doing his job and seeking love. A kind-hearted film with its necessary humor. I loved it. The action and storyline were wonderful. Great film.
1.0,wall_e,"Best Pixar I've seen so far, great story, fantastic visuals"
1.0,wall_e,One of the most heart-touching movies I have ever seen.
1.0,wall_e,"Just when you think you have seen it all with movies like Avatar, comes this lovely movie whose sci-fi plot humbles you into the search for the things we have to value the most: nature and love."
0.0,wall_e,the worst movie ever seen........
1.0,wall_e,Um dos melhores filmes da Pixar. Simplesmente brilhante. Toda vez que revejo acho melhor.

0.0,wall_e,"Best ""Worst Movie"" Ever!"
1.0,wall_e,this movie was everything i expected it to be and more. really adorable!! who knew a cock roach could be so cute!
1.0,wall_e,"This just prooves that the Pixar folks are supreme storytellers. You would expect the visual greatness, but that takes a backseat to the characters. While later viewings may make me wish for a bit less commentary, and more of Wall-E exploring Earth... this movie is just plain great."
1.0,wall_e,"Amazing how they can tell such an amazing robot love story without saying a word. Beautiful visuals and heartwarming story., just the thing we expect from a Disney Pixar."
1.0,wall_e,Another Favorite... Our family watches this one yearly @ least!
1.0,wall_e,By far the best pixar film of all time !!
1.0,wall_e,"Where do I begin? Lovely, charming, stellar images. Forget it being one of the best Pixar films, it's one of the best Sci-Fi films period. WALL-E and Eve have great chemistry together, and the way it looks is just breathtaking. And wait, it's a movie promoting environmentalism that's....SUBTLE???"
1.0,wall_e,Can't saw nothing bad about this movie. Everything was excellent!! PIXAR does it again! A Classic!! An animated 2001.
1.0,wall_e,Freaking phenomenal. The sound design is truly the highlight of Wall-E and of course it's full of beautiful animation. How did Andrew Stanton go from this to John Carter?

1.0,wall_e,"Watched twice this weekend, lacks vocal, but does it need it?"
1.0,wall_e,Cute robots trucking around like they own the place. And they do. This movie is beyond cute.
1.0,wall_e,Not since Bambi has a movie used so much emotion with very little Dialogue. What's wrong with it? Uh....... I got nothing
1.0,wall_e,"Wall -E is just wonderful, especially the first part where Wall-E is on his own just going about his daily business. Nothing else I can add to all the rave reviews it's received, except to say see it on a big screen!"

1.0,war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,War for the Planet of the Apes is among one of the finest epics of our time! Andy Serkis is still impressive and captivating to watch as the great Caesar!
1.0,war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,"Although a very slight drop from the previous film (Dawn) being a bit long/slow at times, it does continue to entertain and keep the reboot collection in tact. Not common to see an original and two sequels all receive such high reviews... great job with the entire reboot for a new generation!"

0.0,war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,"Boring, slow, cheesy, super cut of lifetime TV movie moments, plot didn't make sense, characters did things that did not logically make sense or were not true to character. Really aweful movie."
1.0,war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,"War is one of the best films in general and one of the best third films in a trilogy that completes the arcs it created for its characters, tells a unique original story while also homaging that makes sense, but also does unexpected things with story and how it plays out."
1.0,war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,Serkis and Harrelson sky rocket this movie into being perhaps better than it has any business being. Its commentary on the way we treat one another within society and what truly makes us human is astoundingly visceral and though provoking. Maybe the best film of 2017.
1.0,war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,"Wow. That's all I have to say, it was brilliant. The story is complex and interesting, there were certainly a lot of emotional parts and the action wasn't the best but still one of the best I've seen in a long time."

1.0,war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,"Perhaps the best film of 2017.

1.0,monsters_inc,"Monsters, Inc. is glowing feature debut for the greatest director the animation industry has yet seen, and an outrageously high-concept piece.

1.0,monsters_inc,"I saw it again and it's my favorite Pixar Movie.

1.0,discreet_charm_of_the_bourgeoisie,Wildly weird and funny. This great flick pokes fun at the upper class and all of their distinctly surreal problems.
1.0,discreet_charm_of_the_bourgeoisie,"Only Bunuel could have made this film. Cinima's greatest surrealist. If someone were to say this was the greatest comedy ever made, I wouldn't argue.

1.0,discreet_charm_of_the_bourgeoisie,A clever masterpiece of surrealistic cinema.
1.0,discreet_charm_of_the_bourgeoisie,Bunuel's greatest film. also one of the funniest and weirdest films ever made. Surrealism and comedy perfectly combined.

1.0,discreet_charm_of_the_bourgeoisie,La mas divertida pelicula del maestro Luis Buñuel (y no es una comedia)
1.0,discreet_charm_of_the_bourgeoisie,A series of attempts to get together for a meal pick apart social constructions and desires. Bunuel builds dream logic upon dream logic until the final credits roll. A feat for the eyes and a strain on the mind.
1.0,discreet_charm_of_the_bourgeoisie,One of my favorite movies.
1.0,discreet_charm_of_the_bourgeoisie,a totally surrealistic screwball comedy from Bunuel ! full of memorable dream sequences

1.0,discreet_charm_of_the_bourgeoisie,"Esta es la version cinematografica de ese diabolico fenomeno onirico en el que nos despertemos cuando estamos en la mejor parte. Una serie de vinetas devastadoras con un discreto eje narrativo, que nos recuerda la frase Lacaniana ""El deseo es el deseo a la ausencia""."
1.0,discreet_charm_of_the_bourgeoisie,"Bunuel's masterpiece plays tricks with your mind, but doesn't leave any doubts as to the discreet 'charms' of its bourgeois main characters. A true classic."
1.0,discreet_charm_of_the_bourgeoisie,The satire here is so very sharp. Bunuel has fangs and he's not afraid to bare them. In addition he plays with the form so masterfully; there are dreams within dreams. One is never quite sure where one is. No one gets off without a skewering.
1.0,discreet_charm_of_the_bourgeoisie,Wonderful! Who knew missing dinner could be so much fun?
1.0,discreet_charm_of_the_bourgeoisie,Bunuel was a genius. This film is so surreal. I love it. Great satire. Need to see this one again so I can enjoy all the little gags he does with the dreams. I especially enjoyed when they get arrested towards the end.
1.0,discreet_charm_of_the_bourgeoisie,Many great performances and some of the most bizarre sequences in cinema. Just don't watch it before tea.
1.0,discreet_charm_of_the_bourgeoisie,wow. hm. wacky surrealist comedy with an interesting political message. Craziness.
1.0,discreet_charm_of_the_bourgeoisie,Bunuel excelle ici dans la critique de la bourgeosie Ã  travers un groupe d'amis qui n'arrive jamais Ã  diner. Un mise en scÃ¨ne brillantissime et des situations loufoques dans la tradition du surrÃ©alisme. Bunuel ira encore plus loin avec Le Fantome de la libertÃ©.
1.0,discreet_charm_of_the_bourgeoisie,"A hilariously dark, perturbingly whimsical and outrageously entertaining satire directed at the hypocritic lifestyles of bourgeois.

1.0,discreet_charm_of_the_bourgeoisie,"Who thought having a dinner party could be so difficult? Still, Bunuel shows his genius in taking a simple and absurd plot to make harrowing criticisms on its characters: the rich, the political, the religious, the military - pretty much everyone"
1.0,discreet_charm_of_the_bourgeoisie,"It lacks the political and psychological depth of some of Bunuel's other films. Still, itâ??s loopy narrative structure of digressions, interruptions, dreams within dreams, and pointless story-lines makes it worth watching."
1.0,discreet_charm_of_the_bourgeoisie,"ridiculiza, satiriza pero sobre todo analiza los pequeÃ±os actos y que hay detras de ellos. Imposible no reir del absurdo cotidiano. Excelente."
1.0,discreet_charm_of_the_bourgeoisie,Reminds me of the British sit-com parodies but of course in a French style. BuÃ±uel delivered this great comedy very precisely and made this art house movie also entertaining.

1.0,gojira,Man in rubber suit tramples on matchstick models of Tokyo as denizens look up in terror. The original Godzilla is all that and more. The original Godzilla is far different from the tag team slogfests that followed. Much imitated (I'm talking about you Jurassic Park) but rarely bettered.
1.0,gojira,"Even after all these years, it's still a great movie."
1.0,gojira,"Gojira(Godzilla) is a film of great suspense, brilliant storytelling, amazing effects(for time) and spectacular characters. These factors and more make this my personal pick for the greatest movie of all time."
1.0,gojira,"While the special effects are dated, it still holds up to this day as the best monster movie of all time, offering emotionally gripping human drama that provides a chilling realistic atmosphere. It all builds up to an epic third act that will forever leave us questioning our ethics and morals."
1.0,gojira,original definitely a classic monster movie

1.0,gojira,The amazing birth of the most iconic monster in film history
1.0,gojira,"A Product of the Times, Yet Also Far Ahead of it's Time, Godzilla (or Gojira) remains as a staple of the monster movie, and one of the few to truly take advantage of it, dated, yet timeless, it's a movie that stands as tall as it's title monster"
1.0,gojira,One of the greatest monster movies ever. Genuinely scary too.
1.0,gojira,Godjira is one of the few 1950s monster films that has managed to stand the test of time. It is fantastic!

1.0,gojira,Perfection! Awesome atomic warfare allegory!!! Brilliant!!! So thought-provoking!!!
1.0,gojira,A master peice by every definition of the word. It truly brings to life the horrors of nuclear war and is much more serious and gritty in tone than the more campy sequels of the 60's and 70's. Looking forward to the new one coming may 2014!
1.0,gojira,This movie is Beautiful. A masterpiece. More than a monster movie
1.0,gojira,Gojira is more than your average monster flick; it shows the suffering and pain of a nation that experienced first hand the horrors of the atomic age.

1.0,gojira,Incredible and great. Gojira has a great story and its monster was ficious.
1.0,gojira,"Possibly my favorite monster movie of all time. Godzilla looks menacing and the gritty, black-and-white cinematography and the dark tone makes the destruction of Tokyo look that much more catastrophic."
1.0,gojira,"Every manga, every anime, every cartoon, every movie that deals with monsters has its foundation and influences based around this one iconic monster."
1.0,gojira,"Everyone knows Godzilla, it's a fact. This is the film that started it all, with a strong Anti - Nuke message and a hell of a lot of destruction. It is easy to see why this movie is a cultural icon!"
1.0,gojira,Manages to be a bleak and effective allegory while at the same time being a fun monster movie.
1.0,gojira,"DVD Original, Theatrical"
1.0,gojira,"A great entry in science fiction cinema worldwide. From beggining to end, it is amazing to watch. It takes itself much more serious than what the average person might suppose, and it's a definite ""must-see"" for any sci-fi fan."
0.0,gojira,"It has became a classic, but, I've never liked Gojira at all. It looks really fake."

1.0,gojira,The greatest monster film of all time!
1.0,gojira,One of the best. Ignore the other campier films that came after it (most of which are great in their own humorous way) and start with this. GREAT movie.
1.0,gojira,This movie is a masterpiece.
1.0,gojira,The criterion edition makes the picture quality look better than ever. And i actually like the 1956 American version as well.

1.0,gojira,Beautiful! Rich! Moving! Gojira!
1.0,gojira,"More than just a monster movie, a great social commentary. For those who think the idea of a man in a rubber suit is stupid, it looks far more realistic than CGI! What a classic movie, I enjoy it more every time I watch it."
1.0,gojira,"One of the most incredible movies of all time. No, really. It's far beyond the cheesy 60's Godzilla and totally takes it seriously. As well, its far better than even the U.S. Raymond Burr version. As good, if not better, than the classic King Kong, and deserving of much more appreciation."
1.0,gojira,"Groundbreaking monster film, that tells of the dangers of nuclear bombs. Deals with serious issues via a form of entertainment. Great classic film."
1.0,gojira,Unexpectedly depressing and emotionally resonant. A franchise that turned into silly fun started out as a fascinating anti-war masterpiece.
1.0,gojira,The Classics can never go out of hand. 4 Stars! check it out if you are a godzilla fan!
1.0,gojira,"Truly one of the greatest foreign films ever. It breaks the mold of what a monster movie can be, and started a whole legacy of its own. One of my all time favorites."
1.0,gojira,"On the surface 50's monster B-movie, underneath allegory for war and nuclear weapons. Corny and cheesy at times, it is also haunting and terrifying when it needs to be. This movie pretty much launched the kaiju and tokusatsu film industries in Japan."
1.0,gojira,Stunning japanese masterpeice.
1.0,gojira,Easily one of the best monster movies ever made. The movie looks great in black and white and has nice charm to it. This movie had good special effects for the time and is very enjoyable.

1.0,gojira,"Amazing film. Tells a great story and started the Godzilla franchise. Loved the special effects to, really well made deffinintly a classic. Long Live Toho, Long Live Serizawa."
1.0,gojira,The origianl that shows the beautiful classic affects of Eiji Tsubaraya. And doens't feature perry mason to ruin it.
1.0,gojira,This is a great monster movie that goes beyond the typical campy stuff and actually tells very dark tale with a powerful message about war and its affect on humanity.
1.0,gojira,men in rubber monster suits... this is what classic movie making is ALL about
1.0,gojira,This film got me into Godzilla. Plain and Simple.
1.0,gojira,Classic monster movie. It has never grown old for me.
1.0,gojira,"This is my FAVORITE Godzilla movie, I like it more than final wars. Why? Because it starts the legend of Gojira (Godzilla)"
1.0,gojira,"Absolutely astounding. No other film in the series (with the exception of Return of Godzilla) captures the power and horror of the beast. He is the bomb, and while watching his destruction of Japan, you start to believe it"
1.0,gojira,"If you've only seen the American re-edit, then you haven't seen Godzilla. This one packs an emotional whallop!"
1.0,gojira,As much as I love the Burr version (and I do) the original Japanese version of Gojira (Godzilla) is an absolute masterpiece. It truly captures the horrors that Japan suffered in the aftermath of the atomic bomb.
1.0,gojira,"Godzilla is the man, The beginning of a 50 year monster icon."
1.0,gojira,This is a MASTERPIECE
1.0,gojira,"The original Japanese masterpiece, as it was meant to be seen. Yeah, the American version is a nice 50's monster movie, but this version transcends beyond that, and it's message can be heard for modern audiences at last."
1.0,gojira,"Gojira aka Godzilla (1954) is THE greatest monster movie ever made, and if you can get passed the 50 year old low budget effects you'll see the way Godzilla was meant to be seen"
1.0,gojira,The Japanese version is better than the American (Raymond Burr) version.
1.0,gojira,"A Frankenstein fable for the atomic age, supported by brilliant acting (yes! in a Godzilla movie) and ingenious lighting make this Kaiju classic no laughing matter."
1.0,gojira,"Very dark, and sometimes scary, especially layered shots of Godzilla and the people running at his feet. Very moving, and heavy. Akira Ifikube's score is incredible, and makes the film work. An excellent cast, and compelling story make this a deep impact in cinematic history."
1.0,gojira,"After so many years and so many viewings this film hasn't lost a bit of power or effect. It stands above the rest not because it was the first in the Godzilla series, but because it experiments heavily with a narrative style that resembles what we call cutting edge today."
1.0,gojira,"I'm serious, Godzilla has balls. Other movies go great with Megadeth!"
1.0,gojira,Easily the best monster film ever.
1.0,gojira,The most powerful most moving most purposeful Godzilla movie and the first of them all
1.0,gojira,Amazing in every way
1.0,gojira,A masterpiece of film making
1.0,gojira,The King...the Legend...the greatest monster movie ever made!
1.0,gojira,"if a 400 tall fire breathing political activist monster isn't badass, i don't know what is."
1.0,gojira,The original! Watch the Japanese version to understand the movie better.
1.0,gojira,"THE monster movie of the 20th Century - though also much more. As dark and disturbing a nuclear allegory today as it was in 1954, GOJIRA is, quite simply, a masterpiece."
1.0,gojira,"This movie is a masterpiece. It is more than just a monster running loose film, it is a terrifing reminder of the horrors of nuclear weapons and testing. Seeing a mother huddled in rumble with her two children, telling them they will all be with daddy soon, is heart wrenching in a horrifing manner."
1.0,gojira,Fantastic. Puts a smile on my face every time.
1.0,gojira,"The original Godzilla was a horror movie with no pretense of good and evil, simply the mind-numbing destruction of a man-made force."
1.0,gojira,The one that started it all - deep amazing and moving - this is not just a guy in suit this is a real film a cry against the arms race and the maddness of war. (not that guy in the suit films are bad).
1.0,gojira,The Classic! You Must See!!!
1.0,gojira,One of the best monster movies ever - especially the uncut Japanese original.
1.0,gojira,Nuclear weapons are bad. Movies with big giant fire breathing monsters on a rampage are awesome.  I really want to watch the rest of the Godzilla movies now.
1.0,gojira,This is the original Japanese edit without all the American crap with Raymond Burr sliced in. It's so much better!!
1.0,gojira,This is the best monster movie ever made. It is simply amazing.
1.0,gojira,"The absolute pinnacle of monster movies. This is the measure by which all others are weighed, measured, and found wanting."
1.0,gojira,I love all the TOYO Godzilla films ... but here it started. Even better is the real original version sans Raymond Burr
1.0,gojira,"The first one, and definitely one of the greatest. The original Japanese version, this one, is FAR superior to the Americanization with Raymond Burr. Scarier, too."
1.0,gojira,"Just... too... awesome. This is the kind of monster movie I grew up with, in fact it's the king of them all. It also has a great meaning behind it."
1.0,gojira,This is the one that started it all. The original Japanese cut that is more powerful than the American cut. A classic to change people's view on giant monster movies.
1.0,gojira,"This movie is the original Godzilla, and it's bad ass for being from the 50's. FUCK CLOVERFIELD!"
1.0,gojira,best science fiction film made in japan and the best of the series of godzilla
1.0,gojira,Just terrifying. Still the best monster on film.
1.0,gojira,Top notch sound effects and costumes! A++
1.0,gojira,The Japanese version is better than the American if you don't mind subtitle.
1.0,gojira,"After growing up with the silly American re-working of this film and eventually discovering the original on a low-quality bootleg copy of a copy, it's wonderful to finally have a proper version of this film in my collection."
1.0,gojira,"Sad, unflinching and potent."
1.0,gojira,The first and Still the best.
1.0,gojira,"the ultimate classic that spawned more than 20 sequels and made monster movies what they are today. every monster after this was modeled after godzilla, but you gotta love the big ol lizard. if your a fan of him, you have to have seen this movie. its where it all started."
1.0,gojira,One of my favorite films of all time
1.0,gojira,This is the original un-cut Japanese version which is much longer and more in-depth than the heavily cut American Version.
1.0,gojira,"One of the greatest movies ever made, finally released in America in it's unsanitized version. Even my father, who self identifies as a right wing Republican, loved it when we sat down and watched it together. Watch it with a friend, you'll have something to talk about at the end."
1.0,gojira,The greatest move ever filmed. The true king of all movies.
1.0,gojira,"It's a masterpiece, I am proud of tha t this film affected famous directors after all. It's classic but still better than the remake in Hollywood"
1.0,gojira,Definitely a masterpiece. Groundbreaking filming techniques make this movie a must see for any science fiction fan.
1.0,gojira,great. i didn't think the first godzilla movie would be smart
1.0,gojira,Much more grittier and gripping than the dubbed American version with Raymond Burr. Japanese movies also sound more serious in the original Japanese.
1.0,gojira,"Back when Godzilla movies were serious. Basically, an allegory for the A-Bomb. Also, the greatest giant monster movie of all time."
1.0,gojira,"The original Godzilla, and the only good one. More a social commentary then a monster flick, this movie is compelling and beautifully filmed. One of my favorited movies since I was about 3."
1.0,gojira,"Way betterthan the Americanized bastardization of it. The metaphor was straightforward, yet moving nonetheless."
1.0,gojira,It is an all time classic plus the start really of all the big monster movies. Plus it is one of the better Godzilla films too.
1.0,gojira,A seriously great monster movie.
1.0,gojira,Accept no substitutes.
1.0,gojira,Accept no substitutes.
1.0,gojira,"Do not watch the American cut, accept only the original source of all our terrors, the one and the original. Everyone who made this movie would have PERSONAL connections to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and THIS is their story, a film which has no peers."
1.0,gojira,Haunting and Original! This flick is more than just a monster movie. It packs a real message about the dangers of nuclear weaponry and will no doubt leave you in tears.
1.0,gojira,A short review..if you have never seen a Godzilla movie.THis is the one you should see
1.0,gojira,"Say what you want about the sequels, but don't make fun of this one. It actually succeeds at being serious and bleak."
1.0,gojira,THE greatest monster movie ever made. And that is not an opinion.
1.0,gojira,Pure classic. If only there were more movies like this.
1.0,gojira,Total Classic...I tend to not like monster movies but this is like few others. A lot of politcal comentary in this one.
1.0,gojira,"The classic, the one that started it all and really deserving of classic status, but only the Japanese version not the inferior American version."
1.0,gojira,"For being 1954, spectacular effects, also makes you think about the effect of nuclear weapons. The line from the song godzilla comes to mind. ""History shows again and again how nature points to the falling of man."""
1.0,gojira,"screw Jaws and The Host, this is the best monster-on-the-loose flick ever made, AND a poignant statement about the horrors of war. if you can see the original Japanese version you'll never look at men in suits the same way again."
1.0,gojira,"The Rolls Royce of monster movies, ""Gojira"" is simply a legendary classic."
1.0,gojira,"Possibly the most brilliant and deep monster movie ever, ever. If you've only seen the american version, this is a totally different film."
1.0,gojira,"The original 1954 version is much more in depth than many would be lead to believe, and Akira Ifukube's score is stellar. The American version while butchered is still pretty good."
1.0,gojira,see the original version from japan. It is awesome.
1.0,gojira,"Both versions are great. I think comparison between the two is unnecessary, now that they are sold together. The original is great, Burr is great too. He really knew how to ""serious"" it up! Godzilla used to be scary; but was always fun!!"
1.0,gojira,a landmark in cinema history. incredible movie. one of the best movies ever made.
1.0,gojira,the original is always the best
1.0,gojira,"The 1954 Japanese version is a masterpiece with an obvious allegory and symbolism to WWII and the atomic bombings in Japan. Oh, and the U.S. version is still pretty fun."
1.0,gojira,"The original 1954 masterpiece, and it's FAR different from it's many sequels and imitators. Brilliantly done, and the symbolism is powerful."
1.0,gojira,"""Just go and watch it dammit!!!"""
1.0,gojira,More than a mere monster movie with a guy in a rubber suit smashing cardboard buildings and model tanks and planes. An artful and somber allegory to WWII and the atomic bomb. See this before the American version. It's better.
1.0,gojira,If you don't like this...you aren't a real person. Gojira forever.
1.0,gojira,The Original -and The Best.
1.0,gojira,"Although the effects are dated, the movie remains a compelling allegory for nuclear warfare. While it's not the goofiest, it's the best ""Godzilla"" film. Akira Ifukube supplies a pulse-pounding score."
1.0,gojira,"The one that started it all. If you are a serious Big G fan, you'll watch both. If not, avoid the campiness and watch the original Japanese version. It's more enjoyable."
1.0,gojira,The one that started it all. Japan's allegorical piece about nuclear weapons which would be the foundation of an unlikely long lived franchise.
1.0,gojira,Very underrated. Actually has some very moving scenes and a real message and point. Essential to see the original Japanese version.
1.0,gojira,"A man in a rubber-suit, do I need to say more?"
1.0,gojira,"The beginning of the greatest series of films, ever."
1.0,gojira,Best monster movie. Ever.
1.0,gojira,most people see a giant rubber suit . . . those people are fucking retarded
1.0,gojira,basically the best giant monster film on earth
1.0,gojira,The ultimate giant monster movie. The American version (Godzilla: King of the Monsters) is passable but misses the point.
1.0,gojira,Japanese version all the way! How it was meant to be seen.
1.0,gojira,Godzilla rocks!!!!!!!!! I have loved this movie since I was a little kid!
1.0,gojira,One of the best Japanese films ever made. This is the one that started it all.
1.0,gojira,"The greatest movie ever made. I've seen it over 3,000 times!!!!"
1.0,gojira,Hauntingly beautiful anti-nuclear movie.
1.0,gojira,"Not only a great monster movie, Gojira is a powerful allegory for the atomic age from the one nation that knows the true horror of atomic power."
1.0,gojira,Its Godzilla whats not to like
1.0,gojira,"Godzilla's darkest and perhaps crowning hour, one that represents the monster as not only a city destroying fiend but a threat to man's very extistence. As many other reviews have said the undercurrents of this movie are very deep and potentially very disturbing as well."
1.0,gojira,"Even better in the original Japanese version- Find out how they REALLY feel about us and our ""devices"""
1.0,gojira,"The ORIGINAL!!! No Raymond Burr, etc.."
1.0,gojira,"I was a fan when I was a kid, but I am sticking with this film especially because it is incredible, given that it is from 1954. With the effects they had at the time, this is by far one of the best movies ever made."
1.0,gojira,"very good, very sad, anti war and nuclear weapons movie"
1.0,gojira,This is the very first Godzilla movie for the period it was one of the best post war (WW2) films ever done. The original is a must see. Hands down.
1.0,gojira,"The best G-film period and also a landmark for Horror and Sci-Fi. This film paved the way for other Japanese films, shows, and games to become popular. A film that will go down in history."
1.0,gojira,"The best Godzilla film is the original. unlike every movie after this one, this is genuinly a good movie. (I do like all the other movies, but lets be real, their cheesy as hell.) This movie is full of symbolism about nuclear weapons. I urge everyone to see this movie."
1.0,gojira,"Not what you would expect from the King of the Monsters. This is him before the fame and foes acting as an analogy. a statement in post war Japanese fear and anxiety, a horror of it's time and classic of ours"
1.0,gojira,"Best monster movie, ever. Some of the camerawork is truly brilliant, and Godzilla is a great commentary on post-Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan."
1.0,gojira,"The best Godzilla by far. Its raw film making doesnt patronise the viewer like most modern movies, allowing the simple effects, storyline and atmosphere work its magic."
1.0,gojira,The quintessential Japanese monster movie.
1.0,gojira,The movie that started it all. This movie i saw when i was a little kid and got me into the whole moster movie thing. I have been a fan every since and this movie captivates everything that is amazing about the original movie monster.
1.0,gojira,Do yourself a favour and look past the fact that there's a man in a lizard suit and don't let yourself miss this timeless sci-fi classic! It's was the catalyst for the giant monster movie and also drives home a deeper message about the horrors of nuclear weapons.
1.0,gojira,"The original, the classic. The one that started it all."
1.0,gojira,Great Nuclear Message without all the American Bastardizations.
1.0,gojira,One of the greatest films of all time
1.0,gojira,I've never quite gotten over this movie.
1.0,gojira,"The quintessential giant monster film. Arguably the only one in the genre that can be considered a masterpiece of cinema. Dark and somber in tone, with tons of subtleties. Easily on par with the best the movie world has to offer. Also, giant monster smashing shit."
1.0,gojira,The lack of respect given to this movie and Ishiro Honda sickens me.
1.0,gojira,EXCELLENT. I finally have seen the REAL version. And I loved it.
1.0,gojira,The original. Nothing more to say.
1.0,gojira,Best monster movie of all time.
1.0,gojira,"Finally, America gets to see the origonal film that made Godzilla a ledgend"
1.0,gojira,"It is the undisputed king of all monster movies, a dark and deeply disturbing metaphor for the monster that is American hubris."
1.0,gojira,"They should do a remake, but not like the one they already made. A japanese remake. 'Twould be sweet."
1.0,gojira,"Not just a fantastic monster movie, that's just the selling feature. It's a fantastic anti-war/anti-nuclear movie depicting scenes of struggle and hardship much like the aftermath of Hiroshima."
1.0,gojira,Legendary! That's all you need to know!
1.0,gojira,"Possibly the best monster movie made. Must have been chilling to see only 10 years after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the anti-nuclear arms race message is much clearer in the original version."
1.0,gojira,"This is one of my favorite movies. A terrific anti-war film, one that could only have been made in postwar Japan. And, of course, it brought us the immortal character of Godzilla."
1.0,gojira,"A tense and terrifying monster movie, yes, but also a touching requiem for the horrors visited by World War II, and a call for nobility and self-sacrifice to return in the post-war age."
1.0,gojira,"The original, and best Godzilla is the most serious, dark and depressing of the series with an anti-war message that is as clear today as ever. Very strong characters and thought provoking writing lead this monster masterpiece."
1.0,gojira,My most favorite movie of all time. Not only is it about a giant monster destroying everything it also has a deep and inspiring message. To top it all off there's no Steve Martin. This started a life long obsession for these films.
1.0,gojira,Classic Japanese horror/sci-fi movie. I could sit through a 1000 of these things. I Love this stuff!
1.0,gojira,"Don't see Godzilla, see Gojira."
1.0,gojira,Perhaps the most misunderstood movie of all time. The Japanese version is without question a cinematic milestone.
1.0,gojira,"By far the best godzilla movie, especially the original japanese version without the american scenes in.Definately a defining moment in cinema history."
1.0,gojira,The original and best monster movie ever made.
1.0,gojira,Classics are the best not some movie remade over and over to make money...whom ever made this had something to get across to other people. obviously the attact on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But even in it seriousness still a great movie.
1.0,gojira,This movie pretty much changed my life. I like the original Japanese and Raymond Burr versions for different reasons.
1.0,gojira,"It's a classic and upon recent repeat viewings, an actual movie with characters and emotion and stuff. That was a nice surprise after watching every single other Godzilla movie."
1.0,gojira,Best Kaiju movie ever...hands down!
1.0,gojira,"The original Kaiju film as only Ishiro Honda could have told it. Here Godzilla is a tragic character, an animal who is trapped in a hostile world of technology that is not his own. Gojira is both an amazing and poignant film. That is, unless Raymond Burr comes around."
1.0,gojira,This is probably the best of all the Godzilla movies. I had to buy it when i saw the new DVD. This movie is too good for anyone to miss out on. It is a classic.
1.0,gojira,"The original Kaiju film as only Ishiro Honda could have told it. Here Godzilla is a tragic character, an animal who is trapped in a hostile world of technology that is not his own. Amazing and poignant. That is, unless Raymond Burr comes around."
1.0,gojira,"First-rate cinema, mainly due to Ishiro Honda's smart direction, Akira Ifukube's dread-filled score, and Eiji Tsubayara's special effects. Be sure to check the original Japanese cut and not the hacked up American version. The first Kaiju film is the most thoughtful and interesting."
1.0,gojira,This is the only version that should be viewed. The American version feels like a lobotomized abortion compared to the original Japanese cut.
1.0,gojira,One of the best monster movies.
1.0,gojira,"While I love the Raymond Burr version- and the many sequels- as camp fun, seeing this is like an epiphany. Who knew that a giant monster movie could be so profound, political and, yes, deep."
1.0,gojira,"Forget what you think you know about Godzilla movies, this is a beautiful anti-nuke film which really is king of the monsters. Timeless."
1.0,gojira,The original without Raymond Burr is an absolute masterpiece. What a way to symbolize the horror and destruction of the a-bomb after WWII. I highly recommend picking up the Special Anniversary Edition so that you can see both versions and (hopefully) agree with me. ^^
1.0,gojira,"The best Kaiju film ever, and I'm not jumping on the bandwagon when I say this. It truly is the greatest Kaiju eiga ever made. Don't believe me? Watch it and you'll see."
1.0,gojira,"I really recommend seeing the orgional film, it may defy expectations."
1.0,gojira,accept no imitations. the one and only gojira from the master of kaiju ishiro honda and toho studios
1.0,gojira,"I love the entire series to tell the truth, but the first installment is a nearly perfect bit of film and one of the best movies ever to come out of Japan."
1.0,gojira,The greatest Godzilla film of all time. And number 1 on my top ten list. Gojira is a classic monster film that gets way less credit than it deserves. A brilliant masterpiece in my eyes.
1.0,gojira,The embodiement of the feelings of horror and destruction of the atomic bomb in the form of a 30 story tall lizard.
1.0,gojira,If you can ignore the outdated special effects this is a great monster movie.
1.0,gojira,Japan has never escaped the shadow cast by the mushroom cloud. This is the embodiement of their terror. Not to be mistaken for the fluffier stuff that came later in the series.
1.0,gojira,"Best Godzilla movie ever, and a great allegory about nuclear weapons."
1.0,gojira,"This is a very good movie. Although it is a giant dinosaur, the Japanese know how to make a good monster movie. I can understand why this movie has a anti-nuke message, especially since the movie was released during the Cold War. I think this is a must see classic for everyone!"
1.0,gojira,"Godzilla is the greatest badass in monster history. Not even the Seventh Voyage of Sinbad dragon trumps the theme song and the radiation breath of this lizard. Sorry, Ray."
1.0,gojira,Amazing! I love this movie. YES!
1.0,gojira,one of the greats. all time classic must see monster film. next to king kong one of the most influential important films that few have seen. see the japanese version it truly is a masterpiece
1.0,gojira,the greatest monster film. original japanese version is the only version in my opinion. masterpiece
1.0,gojira,Original 1954 Japanese version of Godzilla without Raymond Burr present (but usa version is also included here). Ishiro Honda's film is a cinema classic.
1.0,gojira,"Somber, sad, haunting, and utterly essential. Really."
1.0,gojira,"The original ""Godzilla"" is still the best. An absolutely groundbreaking and revolutionary film, a monster movie with a message, it's somewhat cheapened by it's multitude of sequels."
1.0,gojira,"Far different from the Raymond Burr ""americanization"" an atomic allegory"
1.0,gojira,"The original Godzilla film was made as a horror film with symbolism to show the negative side to nuclear weapons, long before the campier and sillier films of the 60s and 70s."
1.0,gojira,One of the few horror movies that has a message that still has meaning.
1.0,gojira,Great film of iconic proportions
1.0,gojira,Finally we in the West can watch it without the American cut-ins and dub! Amazing film.
1.0,gojira,First and best. Ingore the man in suit and just watch the greatest film ever made in it full glory.
1.0,gojira,"The original, and still the best."
1.0,gojira,"Sort one of my favorite movies of all time. EVER. King Kong can bite my ass, at least Godzilla said something new, rather than ""it's beauty and the beast, but with GORILLAS and DINOSAURS""! I'll take socio-political commentary over flights of fantasy in at least THIS instance."
1.0,gojira,YEAH! Godzilla/Gojira rules either way! It's about time the original showed up on America's shores . . .
1.0,gojira,By far the greatest monster film ever created. This film does homage to the horror of the hydrogen bomb by artfully suggesting worldwide non-proliferation as the answer.
1.0,gojira,classic monster movie from Japan
1.0,gojira,Gojira (Godzilla) is far better than the American counterpart. I hope Toyo releases a restored version to DVD.
1.0,gojira,A true masterpiece on the horrors of war. Still relevent today. Don't be fooled by what you may have heard about Godzilla. Give this one a chance.

1.0,alien,Classic science fiction/horror movie about the crew aboard a space cargo ship who stop to check out life forms its sensors detect. The chest scene is one of the most memorable scenes in cinematic history. Sigourney Weaver though is what makes this movie a classic I really love.
1.0,alien,"While its characters might be a bit lacking in depth, this hardly takes away from any of the spectacle of the perfect cinematography, set design, and surprisingly tight script and direction."

1.0,alien,Intrigue and suspense mesh beautifully in this classic sci-fi thriller from Ridley Scott.
1.0,alien,A true sci-fi classic.
1.0,alien,I love this movie. It shows the definition of horror and no one can hear you scream. The atmosphere feels terrifying with every character being picked off one by one. It gives jumpscares and enough suspence to keep you holdin the urge to use the bathroom in the theater.
1.0,alien,"Película que rompe de manera brutal con el terror, simplemente una gran obra del género del Terror, enmarcado en un contexto de ciencia ficción."
1.0,alien,"Visually breath-taking even now, this Ridley Scott masterpiece brings to life one of the seminal villains of filmmaking history with a masterful stroke. Instead of relying on gore to provide it's horror, suspense has you on the edge of your street even after it ends."

1.0,alien,Great cult classic that relies on tension more than jump scares.
1.0,alien,"Arguably the best straight up sci-fi horror movie ever made, Alien is a slow burn that grabs you tight and doesn't let go until the credits roll. The acting, suspense, direction, musical score, and script are all top notch, and the film stays scary even after multiple viewings."

1.0,alien,So people think Aliens is better than Alien? Really? Come on...
1.0,alien,"I loved the sequel but this is the original concept, characters. In addition, the design of the ship affected was dirty, gritty and that was a fresh approach to so many previous crafts. Loved this film."

1.0,alien,A masterclass in movie build-up. Exquisite pacing in the hands of a director who is so confident with his characters and story that he lets everything seeps in nice and slow. Then he just unleashes one of most memorable and flat-out terrifying sci-fi creature ever put to films.

1.0,alien,One of the best horror movies ever made. I know a lot of people don't see this movie as a horror flick but just because it's set in space and is in the future is moot. The fact it makes you sit on the edge of your seat and jump at every turn is what mades it amazing.

1.0,dr_strangelove,A funny and interesting piece of satire

1.0,dr_strangelove,Best comedy of all time.
1.0,dr_strangelove,"So realistic and valid to contemporaneity times when despots in the penchant for nuclear arms. Ludicrous to the highest degree, thus effective in the message, it wants to convey. If it's shown worldwide in 2017 that sure will make a universal upheaval against nuclear arms."

1.0,dr_strangelove,Way ahead of its time. The juxtaposition of over-the-top silliness and the terrifying premise of nuclear holocaust paints a powerful image of the current state of world affairs. (and Kubrick saw it forty years ago)
1.0,dr_strangelove,"Probably the greatest black comedy of all time. Released at a time where the seriousness of the cold war and nuclear annihilation was at it's peak, he's able to turn the situation into a great satire. Kubrick's best work, and my personal favorite of his."

1.0,1003033-brazil,"In the pantheon of science fiction lies this landmark of cinema that drives home the twisted visuals blended with an increasingly intense plot.

1.0,1003033-brazil,One of my all time favourite movies. Terry Gilliam at his best.
1.0,1003033-brazil,A superb example of the power of science fiction to anticipate futuretrends by extrapolating it from present reality.
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Brazil is a combination of Orwellian, Kafkaesque, and Cyberpunk themes/aesthetics that creates a surreal experience, fudging the lines between film and dream, which is both bizarre and delightful. I would recommend it, just be sure to fill out you 27B/6 and sign your receipt."
1.0,1003033-brazil,Great movie showing the efficiency of a government .
1.0,1003033-brazil,The best film by Terry Gilliam is this dystopian black comedy. A film that works on so many levels and uses so many elements. I am short of words to express how much I love it.
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Brazil tickles the mind, portraying the entire film from the perspective of Jonathan Pryce's Sam Lowry. A dystopian view of this film can make one ask oneself whether Jill, the main female lead, ever even exists, or is a symbol of Lowry's lament for the bureaucratic autocracy he finds himself in."

1.0,1003033-brazil,"If I were to try to describe Brazil in only a few words, those words would consist of visceral, intense, sardonic, entertaining, and at times surreal.

1.0,1003033-brazil,or havnt you noticed yet
1.0,1003033-brazil,An amazing visual feet. A chilling vision of the Orwell's 1984 mixed with a quirky sense of humor. Strange and surreal. The story of a man trapped in the gears of the bureaucratic machine trying to find his dream girl.
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Terry Gilliam's visionary Orwellian masterpiece is as unique as it gets. You really haven't seen anything quite like it! Odd, unusual, hilariously dark and full of mesmerizing visuals, it's a must see for all film lovers. Gilliam is a true artist!"
1.0,1003033-brazil,Brazil is like Monty Python in the future. It is that funny and good.
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Everything that a Terry Gilliam and a scifi film should be. However, Mr. Gilliam is not so great at dialogue. You will have to suffer through some of the clunkiest dialogue ever but its well worth it."
0.0,1003033-brazil,"Seen it, but I just don't understand what people like so much about it. I couldn't wait for it to finally end. Plus, Gilliam is a shit director who's made little more than Time Bandits..."
1.0,1003033-brazil,"One of my favorite films of all time. So surreal and hopeless and sweet. Even with the weak ending, it still had me wishing I could go back in time and see it again for the first time."
1.0,1003033-brazil,"If Phillip K. Dick and Douglas Adams wrote 1984 chances are it would look something like Brazil; Visually goregous, smartly written, just as funny as it horrifing, and as interesting as any dystopia I've ever seen."
1.0,1003033-brazil,One of the top five greatest films ever made.
1.0,1003033-brazil,The best movie. ever.
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Easily the most confusing film I've ever seen, while also being the most original. My head hurts, but it was worth it. One movie you MUST watch before you die."
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Right off the bat, I'm a Gilliam fan. Sure, he's made a few clunkers but Terry is one brave (damn the torpedoes) director and this is his masterpiece."
1.0,1003033-brazil,Like my friend said Amazing! Terry Gilliam's magnum opus! No wonder Doug Walker loves this film.

1.0,1003033-brazil,Gilliam's masterpiece.
1.0,1003033-brazil,"One of my all-time favorite movies. A dark fantasy on many levels. One of my favorite playwrights, Tom Stoppard, helped Terry create a masterful script. The music and sound help carry the movies tense atmosphere. Don't bother with any version other than the final cut."
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Love that movie. Really reminded me of the book of George Orwell, 1984. i love how dark and criative are the visuals in this film, the acting is also great, everthing works. Simply an unique master piece."
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Terry Gilliam's dystopian comedy is something of a cross between A Clockwork Orange, Monty Python and Blade Runner. A strange mixture no doubt, but the ingenious script and sweet surrealism make this movie an absolute masterpiece. Avoid the version with the happy ending at all costs!"
1.0,1003033-brazil,Love this movie so much
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Such a twist to remember, Brazil is another Gilliam film that will stay in your memory. Bureaucrazy is a main theme and it's great."

1.0,1003033-brazil,An awe-inspiring dystopian fantasy triumph. The almost buffoonish slapstick quality battles the dark Orwellian government to deliver an absolute piece of brilliance. This a must-see for anyone who loves film.

1.0,1003033-brazil,"A visionary movie from Terry Gilliam! Inspiring, crazy, dark! At first, it's hard to enter into this imaginary world, but after that, it's pure joy!"
1.0,1003033-brazil,This film should be shown to all of the vice deputy sub assistants working in human resource departments.
1.0,1003033-brazil,Dystopia at its best. The idea that red tape and paperwork can actually cause a man to dissapear is a prominent feature in the film. This is a great film. It has several different endings that were filmed and it is difficult to decide on a favorite.

1.0,1003033-brazil,"Bizarre and brilliant, Terry Gilliam's take on a totalitarian, dystopian future manages to be just as topical as the books it pokes fun at, while adding a level of hilarity, emotion and grandiosity its predecessors lacked."

1.0,1003033-brazil,"The best Gilliam movie! However stay far away from the ""Love conquers all"" TV-edited version!"
1.0,1003033-brazil,"loosly based off the orwell novel 1984, set in somewhere in the 20th century, this fantasy is packed full of terry gilliam's imagitive storytelling and is a biting satire on 80s' indulgences such as cosmetic surgery. a wonderful film"
0.0,1003033-brazil,"INCREDIBLY OVERRATED. Yes, it's got some good imagery and makes some decent political/social statements and it even conjures a fair amount of thinking in the viewer. But it's just not worth it. The movie is so scattered and irritatingly surreal (and not in a good way either)."
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Funny, quirky, fascinating, and Genius"
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Sad and hilarious, Gilliam makes you weep and laugh at the condition of modern man, and perhaps through the experience reach some sort of catharsis."

1.0,1003033-brazil,"Completely surreal and dull at points, which caused me to strongly consider giving this a poor rating, but the intelligence behind this film wins overall."
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Director Terry Gilliam's Brazil captures its message of insane bureaucrats, surrealism, and insane dark humor to a tee. This movies way of showing how needlessly complicated we make things to supposedly make them easier is brilliant, and by far one of my favorites."
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Monty Python's take on 1984. If you like Orwell, you'll like this."
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Such a wonderfully weird film. Terry Gilliam is a master with visuals, and this is easily the one of the best things that he's ever done. It certainly hasn't aged either since its release 26 years ago. And hopefully, it'll continue to stand the test of time."

1.0,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_fellowship_of_the_ring,To call this cinematic perfection would not do it justice.

1.0,spider_man_homecoming,The best Spider-Man movie yet. It has amazing action scenes and great acting. Tom Holland really shines as the new Spider-Man with a great supporting cast including Zendaya. Tom Holland is by far to me the best Spider-Man ever.

0.0,spider_man_homecoming,"Just watched on Blu-Ray and am not impressed. Acting is amateurish. I am appalled that the fat guy can actually be an actor. I pay good money to see attractive looking people. If I want to see fat people, I would head to the nearest fast food joint."
1.0,spider_man_homecoming,"Surprisingly good. A marvel movie that actually developed the villain somewhat, made you care about the personal life of a superhero just as much as their alter ego. Still, Michael Keaton is a good enough reason to see a movie."

0.0,antz,"Should not be on top movies ever. Boring characters, decent plot, nasty animation."
1.0,antz,"In my opinion this is Dreamworks best film. Funny, mature and wonderfully animated, too bad Dreamworks would rather make films stuffed with pop culture references then this."
1.0,antz,love this film so much
0.0,antz,Hated it....probably because it came out the same year as A Bugs Life.
1.0,antz,"The movie's higher intelligence and advanced use of it's premise showcase DreamWork's penchant for non-catering, which makes it's thematics feel more admirable, if a little alienating, considering its time and mixed appeal."
1.0,antz,Woody Allen and Jennifer Lopez made this movie funny and clever. A great family movie for sure.
0.0,antz,This movie is terrible in every way and a horrible excuse for an animated film. The film reeks of Bug's Life knock-off and was poorly executed across the board.

1.0,1000085-2001_a_space_odyssey,"Intellectually and visually, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a masterpiece. With one film, Kubrick revolutionized film, but even more importantly, the films that copy it today still don't manage to capture the same magic. It is truly a one of a kind."

1.0,1000085-2001_a_space_odyssey,Stanley Kubrick is a visionary! He graced us with this thought provoking work of art and one of the most influential films of all time that can not be understated.

1.0,1000085-2001_a_space_odyssey,"One of the greatest films ever made...easily. 2001: A Space Odyssey is the ultimate film of hypothesis and the ultimate example of how meaning can be so much more impacting through imagery, rather than words."

1.0,1000085-2001_a_space_odyssey,2001: A Space Odyssey is a sheer meditative piece set in outer space. Kubrick uses light and sound in a way that I haven't seen before in a feature film and may be I'll not in the future either. It's a great film and one that needs to be treasured.

1.0,arrival_2016,"It might not seem like much, but ends up delivering much more than expected. Complies and goes that extra mile sci Fi is meant to accomplish. It is a ""must"" (a very enjoyable and EMOTIOnal one) for all sci Fi true lovers."
1.0,arrival_2016,"A near-perfect movie that deals with science, humanity, warfare, family, and the concept of time, but ultimately leaves the question of life and its meaning to the audience. If laser guns against monster aliens are your thing, go see ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" instead."
1.0,arrival_2016,Nothing like a good Ol' fashioned alien movie to make you appreciate your family.
1.0,arrival_2016,Best ever!! Let's your brain fell useful.

1.0,arrival_2016,What a wonderful film. I was a bit confused at the beginning but my confusion was cleared up by the ending. This is by far the best Science Fiction is recent years. Highly recommend for any one who likes a thought provoking story instead of the special effect driven crap that we usually get.
0.0,arrival_2016,Good cast. Horrible movie. Couldn't understand half of the dialog. Long periods of no dialogue at all. Totally confusing. Kept using previous scenes. Don't waste your time.
1.0,arrival_2016,"I gave this movie 5 stars and it definitely deserves it. When the end came around, it gave the movie a whole new spin! This is a movie I could watch over and over again. I highly recommend it!"
0.0,arrival_2016,"This film is probably the most boring i have seen this year, not sure why some are raving over it, it should have been a short 15 minute film. Only watch if you are having trouble trying to sleep."
1.0,arrival_2016,"a good movie , not what I was expecting , Villeneuve brings in the Québec way of doing movies in this masterpiece assembled to perfection in a lower tone. beautiful filmed and wonderfully casted , it is a philophical candy and an ambitious Sci fy loved it"

1.0,arrival_2016,"An absolutely excellent film. I went in with no expectations and was blown away by the mood, concepts and the captivating central character."
1.0,arrival_2016,"Finally saw this. Had seen some negative reviews which kind kept me from watching it. Honestly may be my favorite 2016 movie now. Definitely not an action movie, but such a smart thoughtful experience from beginning to end."
1.0,arrival_2016,"Holy crap!! You need to watch it for yourself. It may start slow, but adding the pieces of the plot together along with the characters leads to a fulfilling ending."
1.0,arrival_2016,Seen in cinema- excellent!
0.0,arrival_2016,Awful. Turned it off after. 15-20 min

0.0,arrival_2016,"How did this movie get such great reviews?? This movie was horrible, boring, anticlimactic and had an ending that made absolutely no sense. Waste of time."
0.0,arrival_2016,"So...""Arrival"" was basically the 2007 Sandra Bullock movie ""Premonition"" combined with ""Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind."" Cinematically, it was pretty. Story/Plot-wise, it was predictable and boring. I fell asleep watching it."
1.0,arrival_2016,Good for what ails us right now

1.0,arrival_2016,"Amazing movie, exactly what I want from sci-fi"
0.0,arrival_2016,"Worst movie since ET. Amy Adams is helpless and hopeless. People act in completely unrealistic ways that make no sense. ""Then a miracle occurs"" is the premise of the move."
1.0,arrival_2016,"Made me think. The ideas were intriguing, and there was kind of a plot twist / surprise in the end. A little formulaic about the reactionary nature of humans (or maybe just realistic). I loved the idea that time is nonlinear. And I want to meet those aliens!"
1.0,arrival_2016,Very well done. Amy Adams is perfect. Best Sci-fi movie since Contact.
1.0,arrival_2016,Give it all the praise!!! Amazing movie
1.0,arrival_2016,"Both Villenveuve and Adams are at their best here. Visually and emotionally stunning. I am, and always will be, dumbfounded that Adams did not receive more recognition for her role in bringing this story to life. The character work and use of misdirection is peak storytelling."
1.0,arrival_2016,WOW this is truly a SFX masterpiece!!
1.0,arrival_2016,"A smart, expertly paced and acted sci-fi thriller. Arrival, once again, proves director Denis Villenueve is one of the modern masters of our time.5/5 stars"

1.0,arrival_2016,one of the best scifi
0.0,arrival_2016,This movie was TERRIBLE! How did it get such a high rating? OMG. It was slow and boring for starters. And the end was just... Dumb.
1.0,arrival_2016,Great acting and a great story! The plot twist at the end is one of the best I've seen in a long time! A must see for Sci Fi fans!
1.0,arrival_2016,This is a special movie. It's not an action movie. It's not a thriller. Its not singular. It's nothing so pigeon-holed. It's f-ing smart. It's beautiful. It's masterfully crafted. Stop reading this. Go watch it.
1.0,arrival_2016,Imagine the thrill of Close Encounters combined with the awe and wonder of 2001 A Space Odyssey. Director Dennis Villeneuve and Writer Eric Heisserer are now at the top of my list of favorite directors and writers.
1.0,arrival_2016,Sublime. Perfectly executed and a fascinating look at perceptions if reality.
1.0,arrival_2016,"I am generally not a fan of science fiction or thrillers, but Amy Adams successfully helms this excellent film that questions our pre-conceived notions of what science fiction really can be."

1.0,arrival_2016,Amazing sci-fi movie!
1.0,arrival_2016,Arrival movie is absolutely Glorious
0.0,arrival_2016,"What a waste of my time, confusing and utterly stupid. WTF is what came to mind at the end. I only watched all of the movie waiting for something to tie together, never did. Had lots of questions that were never answered, just like tv show Lost."
1.0,arrival_2016,I think this is a beautiful movie
1.0,arrival_2016,A well-executed science fiction thriller that also carries a thought-provoking concept down to its structural core.
0.0,arrival_2016,"Best movie by far to fall asleep to! Other than that...overrated, boring, and nothing special. Wish I never saw this movie. What a waste of time and money."
1.0,arrival_2016,Enjoyable sci-fi quasi-thriller with some familiar themes from Contact.
1.0,arrival_2016,"Incredibly powerful movie, a true ""statement of the human condition"".This story is a Shakespearean Tragedy masquerading as a sci-fi movie. That it didn't win multiple academy awards is shameful."
0.0,arrival_2016,Normally I agree with the tomatometer and audience score. I found this the most boring movie I have seen in a long time. I actually watched it to the end in the hope that it would redeem itself but no luck on that front.
1.0,arrival_2016,my favorite film <3
0.0,arrival_2016,"Incredibly pretentious. This is a ""chick flick"" disguised as sifi. The style is ridiculously slow. The concept of the aliens was very good, but the interesting part of the movie, how to understand language was skipped over. Silly movie how it got 94% ratings from the pros is a head scratcher."
1.0,arrival_2016,"Thoughtful, emotional and very moving. Something we all think about but can't quite fathom the logistics of meeting intelligent life outside of our own. Amy Adams shines."
1.0,arrival_2016,"Loved this movie, the plot was so brilliant and i feel like it desserved more awards."
1.0,arrival_2016,An absurdly good contact movie made with believe communication and an incredibly dense plot. One you'll want to pay very close attention to.
1.0,arrival_2016,Inspiring! Stunning sound effects.
1.0,arrival_2016,For once a symbolic story that goes against the typical vilified alien invasion type plot. A beautiful message linking advance communication and precognition skills. One of the most emotionally driven sci-fi movies of all time.
0.0,arrival_2016,"Slow, stupid plot, ridiculous ending what a waste of timeWorst movie of 2016"
0.0,arrival_2016,What a confusing mess. This movie was loaded with suspense...and then had zero pay off. This movie is easily one of the biggest wastes of time I've seen.
1.0,arrival_2016,Thoughtful sci-fi drama with all the visual trappings of a blockbuster but none of the bombast. Engages the heart and the mind like all the best sci-fi.
1.0,arrival_2016,"This movie is moving, well thought out, beautifully presented, and a wonderful performance but Adams. The best movie of 2016 and 2017."

1.0,arrival_2016,A fantastic movie that makes you think. Really beautifully done.
1.0,arrival_2016,A masterclass science fiction that takes multiple viewings to truly appreciate and understand.
1.0,arrival_2016,"Not only looks great, but remains grounded, sustaining a very human and emotional element to the science fiction genre, having a spirit all of its own."
1.0,arrival_2016,"One of my 3 wishes, which for some reason extend to all humanity is to give everyone a common language so 'lost in translation' ceases to exist. This movie shares my desire, thought provoking and beautifully acted."

1.0,arrival_2016,Amazing. This movie is so innovative and interesting. The story and plot line are creative.
1.0,arrival_2016,One of my favourite movies of all time. Amazing. Moving.
0.0,arrival_2016,"I liked the timing and the main topic of the movie. But, the movie proceeds so slowly until the point that it was driving me crazy. I think the exact same plot with exact same acting quality could be done, half the time that this movie took (which is 111 minutes)."
0.0,arrival_2016,"The more I reflect on it, the worse it gets."
1.0,arrival_2016,"This movie is a masterpiece. Every line and every scene is significant and very well though/planned out. The subject matter was brilliant as well, communication...it shines a light on just how complicated it is. This is the best movie I have seen in recent memory."
1.0,arrival_2016,Arrival is an intelligent film that gives a great performance from Amy Adams with language aspects
1.0,arrival_2016,Fantastic. A Must see.
1.0,arrival_2016,"Arrival is something different to the other sci-fi movies, it´s more focus on comunication and inteligence of the humans than the aliens. Amy Adams is amazing so as the story that it will blow your mind at the third act of the movie"
1.0,arrival_2016,One of the best movies I have ever seen by far.
1.0,arrival_2016,"Great movie!!! I am just left with questions, I'll have to watch again and get the answer!Would gladly watch a sequel if there is one!"
1.0,arrival_2016,couldn't take my eyes off the screen. the atmosphere of this movie is truly captivating.
0.0,arrival_2016,Not sure how this show got 93%! Was all excited to see it and boy was it a waste of time. First 45 minutes shear boredom. It was so dark I could hardly see each scene. Could have been so much better. Wish I could get me money back. Human Human Human ink blot ink blot octopus are now aliens!
1.0,arrival_2016,"A really good movie. Im a smart person but I don't know if I'm smart enough for this movie. I really liked it, not one I'll buy but one I'll watch when ever its on to try and better understand it."
1.0,arrival_2016,A tour-de-force. Equally riveting and revitalizing as it is meditative and poetic in its exploration of humanity.
0.0,arrival_2016,This was easily the worst movie I have seen in a while. The boring drawn out plot that had such a poor careless ending. I literally would put this movie on any time you're having insomnia as it is guaranteed to remedy that issue. It only deserves 93% as sleeping medicine. Absolutely awful flim
1.0,arrival_2016,"One of the most underated movies of 2016. An amazing original story, great cast and cinematography. But the music waa on another level. The actors did not have to speak, the music told the whole story."
0.0,arrival_2016,"One of the most boring ""aliens come to earth"" movies I have ever seen. The plot is also implausible and forced. Other than some of the visual effects, the film is unwatchable."
1.0,arrival_2016,"Simply marvelous. Excellent script, actors, everything was amazing"
1.0,arrival_2016,It's not really a complex movie it's pretty easy to understand...it's just meh. Starts strong then gets a tad slow for a hour then gets going last 20 mins. Not really a great story but does make you think about what if you knew your future.
1.0,arrival_2016,Smart sci-fi for adults.
0.0,arrival_2016,Quit possibly one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time
1.0,arrival_2016,Never thought I'd see a movie so thoughtful about Squid aliens and language. But I couldn't be happier about it.
1.0,arrival_2016,A total tear jerker!
1.0,arrival_2016,"Though you will see plenty of nods to past sci fi films and plenty of re-hashed themes, Arrival amply creates an amazing thought provoking sci fi with human morality. Amy Adams is on top of her game once again and once you fully grasp the film and its heady concept, you will be blown away."

1.0,arrival_2016,Definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's mind-blowing and yet I still understood it.
0.0,arrival_2016,Nothing happens. Aliens come to save humanity in hopes that one day humanity will save them. One woman is the key and saves both. Aliens leave. The end. No action. Incredibly slow. Nothing to engage the audience. Would never recommend to anyone.
1.0,arrival_2016,"Arrival is a highly inspiring movie, setting up the topic of extraterrestrial visitors from a whole different point of view. The intelligent storyline and a tense yet not overly thrilling narrative make this movie a great sci-fi experience."

1.0,arrival_2016,The GOOD movie from 2016 about Amy Adams and aliens the government doesn't quite trust. Arrival is smart and stays smart all the way to the end rather than just turning into a CGI action movie in the third act like a lesser movie would have. The twist is great and it makes you think.
1.0,arrival_2016,"Wow... this movie was basically perfect for me. Great sci fi (my writing passion), linguistics (my education), smart story, & an almost gut wrenching finale when the truth comes together & my mouth is left gaping from the mind-blowing outcome. Phenomenal movie."

1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Colin Clive's mad performance and the legendary Boris Karloff dominate this classic. It's a shame that Clive died so young. His nuanced performance, alongside the moody but innocent Karloff, make this a genre standout that is imitated even today."

1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"It's got to be one of the darkest films ever made during the 1930's, even now I'd consider it to be pretty morbid. It definitely lives up to the hype the main three monster movies. I would hold it as one of the greatest science fiction movies ever made"
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,truley an amazing film!

1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"just a great film. For 1931 what Whale created was just epic. Obviously very influenced by German Expressionists, especially in his use of shadowing, lighting and set design. He also effectively used sound to further the horror. And Karloff was awesome."

1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"""That's Frank-en-steen"" (from ""Young Frankenstein""). I really loved this classic based on Mary Shelley's book. It's not frightening at all; more warm then anything else. A winner!"
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,The film's merrit is earned in Whale's direction and Karloff's brilliant performance rather than total purity to Shelley's novel. Truly a film classic worth watching again for the sake of pure cinematic elements. One of the best horror movies ever made.

1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Great performances all around make this an endearing horror classic. A great reflection of how humankind can be more monstrous than any ""monster"" that can be created by man. Karloff is amazing at garnering sympathy even with his brutish visage."

1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Frankenstein scared me to death when I was a kid. Boris Karloff is fabulous as the frightening, but misunderstood monster."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,One of the all-time great horror flicks. I can't get enough Karloff.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Iconic horror film, dated but still impressive."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,A disturbing bet yet eye opening film of what happens when man himself decides to become the creator instead of letting nature take it's normal route.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Classic meditation on: beauty,death,size discrimination,the origins of crime,childbirth and many other deep themes in this awesome movie."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Classic! Boris Karloff was awesome as the Monster.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Deviating from the novel, which is my favorite of the Victorian era, the fact that it was concocted by a group of simple Hollywood marketers is quite apparent. I new it would be campy, but I think that aspect made it funner to watch."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"One of my favorite movies. Brilliantly made. Even better perhaps, than the often touted Bride of Frankenstein."

1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"I love this Movie to death! I like it just as much as the Wolf Man, my favorite! It has a great storyline, and by the end, you feel sympathy for the Monster. I think Boris Karloff is the best Frankenstein so far! ;)"
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Frankenstein is my favorite classic horror series. Boris Karloff is the perfect actor to play the monster. In the end I really end up feeling bad for him b/c he tries so hard to fit in nobody accepts him.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Boris Karloff rules.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,I'd fuck this movie. Seriously.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Frankenstein is the best monster on the face of the entire earth, and Boris Karloff is the best Frankenstein on the face of the earth."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"The classic Universal version of Frankenstein. Despite taking a few liberties with the source material (including changing Dr. Frankenstein's first name), the film remains a classic after 77 years and its not hard to see why."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,not only one of the best horror movies ever...but one of the best movies ever.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Saw it when I was 5 years old. First horror movie I ever saw. I've been in love with it ever since.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,I always think about Bela Legosi in 'Ed Wood' calling Boris Karloff a cocksucker. But this is still a classic.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"The finest horror film ever made. James Whale is a great director. And Karloff, what an amazing, talented actor. He is responsible for the worlds greatest horror icon."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"IMO, it's still the greatest! It's so iconic and has impacted every good horror director. The monster is loose!"
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Greatest and most influencial movie ever made!
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,James Whale's masterful adaptation of Shelley's tale of family tragedy and science gone wrong. Not quite DRACULA but one of Universal's horror lynchpins.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Boris Karloff! Classic
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,A horror film classic!!!! This is my favorite Universal Monster.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Boris Karloff is amazing in this film as the not-so-gentle giant. An all-time classic.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"A materpiece. From Boris Karloff's brilliant pantomime to Colin Clive's manic jadeness this is a classic. The production design, from the expressionist motifs to the legendary laboratory are iconic."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,A classic for a reason.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Karloff is once again amazing and doesn't utter a complete sentence in the film. Wonder what it would have been like if Lugosi had not turned down the roll of the Monster?????
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Still stands the test of time
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Hollywood has made some really, really great films: Casablanca, this...I'm sure there are others."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Universal did no wrong in the '30s and '40s when it came to monster movies.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Karloff in his most memorable role. Great!
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,This is the very best of the Universal Monsters era...the golden age of horror ghouls. I love Frank!
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"OK, this had NOTHING to do with the book, but broke new ground, regardless."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Dear lord!! There is something about this movie that gets me. Older horror movies, with the grainy dark black and white cinematography, always have that particular creepy thing going for them and this is the one that REALLY took it home. It still is creepy today IMO."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,I am a big fan of the classics and this is one of my faves.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,possibly the greatest horror movie of all time. karloff was the mannn.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"A perfect horror film, even if it's dated. Man playing God is never good. Clive is just about the worst parent in film history, and Karloff's performance is probably as great as any I've seen."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,the original frankenstein film rules
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"An absolute wonder! It may not be all that faithful to Mary Shelly's gothic tome, but it's iconic nonetheless. Karloff is extraordinary, you'll feast on the cinematic wizardry on display."
1.0,blade_runner,Ótimo filme com o futuro sombrio que viria a influenciar muitos outros filmes nos anos seguintes. A história é um tanto confusa no início e o ambiente eternamente úmido cansa um pouco pelo filme ser longo.

1.0,blade_runner,"Classic sci-fi movie that pulls all the right punches, this is one of those movies that should be viewed twice: The original cut followed immediately by the director's cut. A dark, dismal view of the future with Rutger Hauer chasing you through a building is a fun ride, to me."

1.0,blade_runner,still such a iconic 80s sci-fi classic watched the final cut but I still prefer the original version it had a better ending/editing
1.0,blade_runner,this is a a wonderful movie and i just had a few thoughts as to what caused it to be a great movie. i believe the actors they had for the part were perfect for the role they played. the ending is confusing and hard to understand thought.

1.0,blade_runner,great movie with a great performance from harrison ford in his iconic role although since i watched the final cut it was slightly more confusing
1.0,blade_runner,This and Aliens are my fav two sci-fi films of ALL time!
1.0,blade_runner,The music by Vangelis and the gorgeous cinematography of Jordan Cronenweth are the highlights of this film.
1.0,blade_runner,"One of the greatest sic-fi flicks of all time, if not the greatest. This film really discusses the issue of being human, and in the end it makes it's statement when the replicant saves the life of the human trying to kill him, proving who is more humane."
1.0,repo_man,My favorite movie ever.
1.0,repo_man,"One could say this movie is many genres and things jumbled up into one. Whatever it is, it definitely isn't boring. This movie is one of the most random, cooky, and outlandish out there. But it's great. It covers a lot of important themes."
1.0,repo_man,"Characters that jump off of the screen. A plot so far fetched that even the most serious of watchers will crack a smile. Off the wall, exciting, and with killer tunes to boot. You'll be eager to grab a white and blue beverage after the show. A cult classic!"

0.0,repo_man,I'll just say outright that I don't get this film. It has a somewhat decent scifi premise but only a few scenes expand on this. Mostly this is just bad comedy bits and other bits of nonsense strung together. I was not a fan.
0.0,repo_man,11/26/2015: Not a good movie. The acting and story were both pretty bad. I don't understand the high scores.
1.0,repo_man,"Alex Cox was mildly Godardian. This and the Sid Vicious biopic, Sid & Nancy, were really quite wonderful and then nothing. Repo Man was insanely watchable, though, and once you've seen it it's nothing you'll ever forget."

1.0,repo_man,Great movie. Emilio Esteveez is utterly believable as the young punk who ends up working in system.
0.0,repo_man,Whoever came up with this storyline had no imagination.
1.0,repo_man,Quirky film about an aloof punk-rocker who accidentally becomes an auto reposseser. They actually manage to fit in a whole subplot about aliens somewhere in the mix. many memorable lines and moments of intentional camp make this a bizzare classic.
1.0,repo_man,It all about the junk in your trunk

1.0,repo_man,"Otto is a suburban L.A. punk who accepts a job as a repo man and finds himself embroiled in a wild plot involving a '64 Chevy Malibu, the CIA, and a dead Alien. This movie has a vicious sense of humor aimed straight at the jugular of the Reagan era. The greatest punk soundtrack ever compiled."
1.0,repo_man,"My favorite cult classic ever! It's a cool film, with only one boring scene. It's plot is all twisted around from stealing cars, to deadly alien inventions. It's jokes are also hilarious. Overall, I recommend this to anyone."
1.0,repo_man,Excellent cult film!
1.0,repo_man,Repo Man probably does not compute for many folks...it is a surreal story about Southern California in the 1980's so may have too much subcultural specificity....Also you need to like Punk Rock...
1.0,repo_man,Funky 80's classiic with a confused yet extremely sexy Emilio Estevez

1.0,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_return_of_the_king,"Mr. Jackson, you have created a masterpiece in film-making that will stay as timeless as the epic itself. With each composition framed to perfection, the background, the setting and movement tell us so much that the dialogue becomes bonus, rather than means to progress the plot."
1.0,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_return_of_the_king,I loved it! :P :P :P
1.0,children_of_men,Wonderful. Has everything one would want in a movie.
1.0,children_of_men,a masterpiece showing the full range of emotion on film. the bleakness is an amazing backdrop for a journey of personal redemption.I love how the world isn't overexplained. elements of it come through in passing
1.0,children_of_men,Master film-making. This movie got me to start watching movies in the theater again. Kudos in every notion. Tears of joy at the end. Thank you Universal.
1.0,children_of_men,"One of the best films I have ever seen. The performances, the cinematography, the story. Everything is rich with color in this dystopian sci-fi thriller. Definitely worth a watch."
1.0,children_of_men,"Maybe the film with the greatest cinematography ever made. In addition to being a phenomenally well written, directed and acted dystopian social spectacle. A film that should be considered one of the best and will be more widely appreciated in the future."
1.0,children_of_men,"There is a lot that can be said of the greatness of Children of Men, but it is that it begs us to understand the importance of children in that without them we have no future."
1.0,children_of_men,"From the documentary style and wildly imaginative writing, you can feel the sickness and the depravity of the world, the constant war and danger, but the implications it hints at are sophisticated and relevant for the foreseeable future and has the most profound impact."
0.0,children_of_men,Is an absurd movie...
1.0,children_of_men,"A terrific movie. It's rather a stretch to call it scifi, but I suppose because of the future setting, and the scientific nature of the problem, it counts as such. But it side steps all of the tropes. Clive Owen gives the performance of his career."
1.0,children_of_men,"This very realistic and quite possibly prophetic drama featuring plenty of suspense, action and intelligent dialogue raises many important political and humanist related questions that are more relevant today then ever before."
0.0,children_of_men,Waited 11 year to get round to watch this and thought it was awful
1.0,children_of_men,"*****Grim, bleak, and yet at its centre full of hope. 'Children of Men' is a fantastic, if sometimes depressing, look into the future, with an amazing performance by Clive Owen and astounding visuals. Highly overlooked."
0.0,children_of_men,"It's reviews like this that have caused me to lose faith in RT. This movie was barely B grade. Terrible acting, plot was interesting but didn't progress or have any substance.

1.0,children_of_men,"Children of men is equal parts thrilling, haunting, human, bleak and beautiful, and it is by far and away one of the best movies of the 2010's."
1.0,children_of_men,An eerily prophetic and emotionally devastating picture that stands to become a beacon of originality in the annals of cinema. Definitive and essential.
1.0,children_of_men,"So raw, so real, and incredibly intense. A believable future in chaos."
1.0,children_of_men,"Visually stunning, ""Children of Men"" counts with amazing performances and a masterful direction, its final act left me without words and made me tear up in a reflection about what humanity and hope is. Truly a modern sci-fi master piece."

1.0,children_of_men,"Amazingly awesome, a perfectly made film. The single shot battle sequences are jaw-dropping, and after the first 20 minutes you're completely hooked on the story."
1.0,children_of_men,"In my nearly 50 years, this is definitely one of the top 10 movies I have seen. I did not see it until 9 years after it came out. It seems now quite prescient."
0.0,children_of_men,This movie is boring and full of nonsense talking. Stopped movie after 40 mins watching both me and my sister think it's bad. I don't know who can like this stupid movie

1.0,children_of_men,"Suspenseful, action-packed and superbly acted and shot dystopian thriller with an amazing cast that will leave a lasting impression on you long after the credits roll."
1.0,children_of_men,"There's none of the labored exposition these types of dystopian thrillers usually have and Cuaron packs every frame with details that slowly reveal a complex world outside of the main plot. It's also tremendously moving, because the film has the perfect balance of cynicism and hope."

1.0,children_of_men,"One of the most poignant films I've seen - a unique work of heartbreaking beauty.

1.0,children_of_men,Fantastic film!!!!!!
1.0,children_of_men,"Utterly raw and real, Alfonso Cuarón's Children of Men is a different sort of dystopia film, one that harks back to the classics. Gorgeously shot and executed impeccably, Cuarón is definitely the director to be watching for the foreseeable future."
1.0,children_of_men,"One of the few movies that's just flat-out better than the book. Provoking, dystopian story that makes you think. Also, the cinematography is jaw-dropping."
1.0,children_of_men,This is a brilliant film but when I first watch this movie I was not a fan but I watched the movie again and I don't know what I was smoking.
1.0,children_of_men,Definitely in my top 10!!
1.0,children_of_men,"A grim yet ultimately triumphant film, Children of Men is a shining example of life and hope prevailing over death and despair."
0.0,children_of_men,"This film is not a thrilles, not a drama, not a tale of woe, not even a parody. It is a piece of shit that pretends to be great art just because there is ripped paper everywhere and the protagonist is moody and swears a lot."
1.0,children_of_men,"The combination of gritty cinematography, pacing, striking violence and ultimately believeable-if-grim futuristic premise make it a hard-hitting drama that as the consensus says delivers on every level. The sense of realism throughout and technically proflic camerawork in presenting this is superb."
1.0,children_of_men,"Children of Mens realistic, grounded future setting, as well as its messages of hope and humanity make this movie a rare and special treat."
1.0,children_of_men,"the set pieces will blow your mind as well as the long camera takes, unbelievable in HD"
1.0,children_of_men,Cuaron portrays humanity in an advanced state of decay. The use of John Tavener's Fragments of a Prayer symbolises his spiritual reaction to this unavoidable and haunting future.
1.0,children_of_men,Amazing! How did someone come up with a plot like this?
1.0,children_of_men,one of my favorites: cuaron is a master director and this film has depths well worth countless rewatches

1.0,children_of_men,"In the darkness of despair flickers a light of hope - as well as a summation of the movie this could be applied to filmmaking in general. A bleak, bold, bravaro movie with some outstanding set pieces"
1.0,children_of_men,"Bold, brutal, and hauntingly realistic."
1.0,children_of_men,Brilliant film making by Alfonso Cuaron. Some of the best camera work I have ever seen in movie history. This is easily one of the greatest science fiction films of all time.

1.0,children_of_men,A masterpiece in direction. Alfonso Cureon does it again with the most impressive tracking shots ever captured on film. 10/10
1.0,children_of_men,Cuarón injects a documentarian style into his dystopic swan song for humanity that sucks the audience in right out of the gate and never relents. A grim majesty of sweeping alarm and quiet gravitas.
1.0,children_of_men,"I was very impressed. I can't really say anything is wrong with this movie. Not only is it a scary apocalypse movie, it's a really movie with it's awesome directing, acting, and script. Give it a shot."

1.0,children_of_men,Great movie! Well put together and great acting.
1.0,children_of_men,"Easily one of the best movies I have ever seen. Clive Owen, who I didn't expect much from, is incredibly committed to his role, and the very concept is enough to take your breath away. I think RT's consensus sums it all up; this is a movie that warrants a long-ass description."
1.0,children_of_men,"The most harrowing, realistic, well-defined look at the future I've ever seen paired with some of the most incredible cinematography and tension make ""Children of Men"" terrific."

1.0,children_of_men,"Some of the best cinematography and direction that I've ever seen, 'Children Of Men' is a scary warning of where we're headed as a species and is never hopeful, much like a dystopian future would be."
0.0,children_of_men,This movie was a mess. Rates right down there with my least favorite movies. I'm starting to think if the critics like a movie I will end up hating it....if they hate a movie I usually like it.

1.0,children_of_men,"Grim take on humanity, but fantastic story. It will grip you."
1.0,children_of_men,I went to see this expecting something totally different. I ended up being pleasantly surprised. Make sure you don't watch it with someone who talks during movies. There is one scene in particular near the end that I found very touching and well done.

1.0,children_of_men,A fascinating possibility of the future. Worth seeing simply for the messages it sends.
1.0,children_of_men,"Owen, Moore, Caine . . . what more can I ask for in a cast. The film's cinematography is eerily beautiful and the range of emotions it elicits is sometimes overwhelmingly. I could not help but think that were this event to happen, this could very likely be the outcome."

1.0,children_of_men,One of the finest sci-fis of the past 10 years and quite possibly the best shot. Cuaron stages unbelievably long continuous takes that are mind-boggling in their complexity.

1.0,empire_strikes_back,The best of the trilogy with greater character depth and realism you don't really find in sci-fi movies. Setting the bar high for a fantastic set of movies unfortunately ruined by Return Of Jedi...

1.0,empire_strikes_back,Still my favorite movie of all time.
1.0,empire_strikes_back,"The force is running in the family, but previous to that revelation this is the best of the entire saga due to a number of unpredictable twists.

1.0,empire_strikes_back,Definitely the best Star Wars film yet
1.0,empire_strikes_back,Err Star Wars need I say more
0.0,empire_strikes_back,This movie is bad because no military strategist would ever land troops on a planet like Hoth. You would just bomb the surface or destroy the entire planet and boom you have the end of that line of the story. A logical and much more likely outcome.
1.0,empire_strikes_back,"The best of the series. Darker than its predecessor, but even more enjoyable. Right from the start with the AT-ATs at the Battle of hoth it shows tremendous ambition. Darth Vader is a fantastic villain and the tooing and frowing between Leia and Solo adds some decent comedy"
1.0,empire_strikes_back,Amazing...My 2nd best film of all time behind of Citizen Kane. A childhood favorite and still is.
1.0,empire_strikes_back,In my not so humble opinion the most genuine due to its refreshing approach to the duality of man and its willingness to delve into uncharted territories and explore the darker side of man with such gusto and unbridled passion!

1.0,1000617-aliens,"Easily one of the best James Cameron movies. With fantastic action, this is one badass thrill ride. This and Terminator 2 prove why Cameron is the god of action sequences."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"One of the best action films ever made, Aliens is James Cameron's and the Alien franchise's best film."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Hard to find fault in this film, by far the strongest in the franchise. It's just another example of James Cameron being a master of sci fi action pictures. It's got a great storyline great cast and great visual effects. It's the one Alien film you can watch over and over."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"More of an sci-fi action flick than a sci-fi horror flick like it's predecessor, Aliens delivers an explosion of thrills that improves on the ideas of the first film."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Filled with great performances, gorgeous direction, and exhilarating action, Aliens is still one of the greatest Sci-Fi films ever made."
1.0,1000617-aliens,I would love to see a new one of this caliber!!!!
1.0,1000617-aliens,A superior action sequel better than than the first.
1.0,1000617-aliens,My one comment on this movie is as follows... take down Gene Siskel's lackadaisical attempt at writing a review on this timeless masterpiece.
1.0,1000617-aliens,One of the greatest films of all time.
1.0,1000617-aliens,Awesome sci fi horror movie!
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Aliens is one of the rare sequels that is even better than the original. By taking everything such as the masterful execution of suspense and character development, Aliens transcends being just a horror thriller but also a great action and drama movie as well."
0.0,1000617-aliens,"This is a very hard movie to get through, reminded me a lot of Avatar. How can this be that big a drop in quality from the original."
1.0,1000617-aliens,A great sequel to a ground breaking film! Riply is the most bad ass chick to ever hit the movie screen and she does not even mean to be bad ass either. The alien is one of the most unique creatures ever created.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Better than the original. Filled with more action than the first and somehow builds on an even better atmospheric story, and still has the same amazing effects as it's predecessor. Well James Cameron, I will accept you for some movies, and this shall be one of the movies."
1.0,1000617-aliens,best overall of the series.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"James Cameron is my favorite director, and possibly the best director of the 20th century. The detail he puts in this movie goes without saying."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Without argue, Aliens has made itself a big name compared to the original and brings you to a whole new scene of the same xenomorph monsters we always loved before!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"This is an outstanding movie. Moving, action packed and fast paced."
1.0,1000617-aliens,One of the best films I have ever seen. Loved every second of it.
1.0,1000617-aliens,It's some of the same formula from the last movie but comes off fresh with a new cast of more fleshed out characters (except ripely). Debatably this is a better sequel but it's unfair to compare the two because they are different genres but they are both fantastic movies.
1.0,1000617-aliens,The rise of Bill Paxton.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Excellent movie. For it's time it did exceptionally well with effect. Aliens used no CGI effect, it was all puppets and costumes - genius"
1.0,1000617-aliens,One of the best sequels ever made and a sci-fi horror action classic
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Thrilling roller coaster of a film that has a little bit of everything...sci-fi, horror action, gore...you name it, it's got it all tied up in a nice, tight package. Great acting, wild effects and great direction help make this the true classic it's become."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Once again,the even better sequel Aliens,gives us what made its original great ,and adding more with its colonial marines,strong performances,action packed,with its non-forgettable quote ""Its game over man,game over!"",and the weapons make this sequel worth the while to watch."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"A full blown science fiction classic. It was as great (albeit starkly different) as the first and far better than the rest in the series. The atmospheric tension, and surprisingly good acting made this film a roller coaster ride of thrills, kills, and big black aliens."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Faster paced than the first, but just as good. ""Aliens"" is once again a superb entry in the genre."
0.0,1000617-aliens,-: that fucking little girl...opposite of plot driven story telling. Everything seems so predictable and unnatural.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Game over man, Game over"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"while Alien was a masterpiece of a horror/ sci-fi film, Aliens was a masterpiece of an action/ sci-fi film. easily the best action movie ever made, with an original story that has been duplicated many times *cough* Halo *cough*"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"While ""Alien"" is a fantastic Sci-Fi Horror film, ""Aliens"" is a fantastic Sci-Fi Action film with horror elements. It's well directed, superbly acted, and more memorable than the original. Oh, and the Colonial Marines, really awesome!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"American classic enough said, but really what else is their to say about Aliens"
1.0,1000617-aliens,James Cameron not only reinvented the scifi horror of Alien but turned it into a heart stopping military action film with some of the most lovable soldiers ever put to film.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"A sharp contrast to the original (a roller coaster ride of action and violence, yet still intense and frightening, capped off with a legendary performance by Sigourney Weaver."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Heartbreaking, thrilling and exhilarating. There has never been a move classic thriller/horror movie. It's not at all hard to get sucked up into it's madness."
1.0,1000617-aliens,The bitch of all action films!!
1.0,1000617-aliens,"My favorite Alien film! One other Cameroon's classic. Action, thriller, horror and emotion Aliens all have it. One of the most successful sequel of the movie history..."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Masterpiece, especially in the extended version. One of those films I just love."
1.0,1000617-aliens,One of the few times a sequel is actually better then the original. 10/10
1.0,1000617-aliens,"The greatest sequel ever made! May not be a horror film like the first one, but Cameron created a suspenseful, thrilling, and action packed alien film. Expanded the universe to a whole new level!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Similar to its counterpart in themes and plot but much more intense and gripping, Aliens combines the best parts of the horror and sci-fi genres to create an awe-inspiring action masterpiece, as well as utilising the considerable talents of Sigourney Weaver and James Cameron."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Action,Suspence,Scares,Plot,Characters, and the badass xenomorph queen makes this movie a great watch."

1.0,1000617-aliens,"The best Alien film ever made! The first was a horror film, this is the action roller coaster ride. It's the best film in the series, and far superior to that crap spin off film Prometheus."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Tense, intelligent and innovative. Aliens is as good as its predecessor"
1.0,1000617-aliens,Amazing! With great special effects and exceptional acting. This is a great improvement over an outstanding preceder
1.0,1000617-aliens,"The best sequel of all time, James Cameron does the impossible and takes the atmospheric and heart pounding ""alien"" and makes it a fast paced thrill ride sequel."
1.0,1000617-aliens,Classic of our generation
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Truthfully, one of the best movies I've seen and arguably one of the best movies of its decade, while the killer performance Sigoueney Weaver blew me out of my socks, the plot development with the suspense mixed in, makes me say 5 stars!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Possibly the best movie ever made, in my opinion. For a movie from the 80's, this one had it all: actors, crew, effects, plot, action. Everything."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"The zenith of sci-fi films. Weaver eclipses her role once again, as Cameron takes the reigns in a more intense action directing with memorable moments and relatable characters."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Even better than the first, ""Aliens"" is just as creepy, but more intense and filled with memorable scenes, lines and tons of action."
1.0,1000617-aliens,This is how you make a great sequel.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"While not only scary, it's well written, perfectly action packed, phenomenally acted especially by Sigourney Weaver, and like it's predecessor, creative in terms of set design. Aliens stands very tall within the sci-fi film pantheon."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"In my all time top 5. Michael Biehn's ""Hicks"" character is right at the top of my all time favorite characters as well as performances. The movie holds up so well almost thirty years after it's release. Genius cinema."
1.0,1000617-aliens,The tension was so thick you could cut it with a knife!
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Another example of James Cameron making a superior sequel, Aliens is without a doubt an improvement by adding explosive action and gritty performances."
1.0,1000617-aliens,My favorite movie in the Alien series. Space Marines with super weapons versus vast army of savage Aliens!
1.0,1000617-aliens,The best Alien-movie ever!
1.0,1000617-aliens,I own this on DVD and on Blu-Ray in a four movie pack along with:* Alien (1979)* Alien3 (1992)* Alien Resurrection (1997)
1.0,1000617-aliens,This might be better than the first movie! :)
1.0,1000617-aliens,This movie is a great action movie. Classic. Love it! James Cameron's best work.
1.0,1000617-aliens,5/5 * An extremly effective action horror thriller that surpasses the original in some respects presenting the main lead as a horror iconic hero with visceral and emotional fury.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Aliens is the classic example of a great si-fi movie. This film is one that every Sci-Fi, James Cameron, or Alien fanatic should check out."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"""Aliens"" is even more action-packed and alien-filled than the original."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Next best movie ever made... Game over man, Game over!!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"I actually had never seen this until last night. It was PHENOMENAL. Alien was good....a good solid horror movie. But this movie was just amazing. Ripley is a strong female leader, but she can be maternal as well. And the story....just....freaking....wonderful."
1.0,1000617-aliens,Classic. Badass female character taking on monsters. Intense and entertaining. Loved it.
1.0,1000617-aliens,Aliens throws intense action sequences into the mix and still retains much of the terror and horror from it's predecessor and both are surprisingly blended together magnificently. Aliens is a great sequel and an equally great movie.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"As James Rolfe (the AVGN) said, James Cameron can go to the grave knowing he made two of the best action sequels ever in cinema, one of which is ""Aliens."""
0.0,1000617-aliens,"Another shitty shitty movie. The action scenes are boring. There is no suspense. The ""military are bad"" theme is old and tired and not explored in any nuanced way here. The climax is hilariously awful. AJDSKFJDS"
1.0,1000617-aliens,Probably one of the best action movies ever made.
1.0,1000617-aliens,Best Sci-fi honor of all time.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"SIgourney. Ah, Sigourney. Sigourney, Sigourney, Sigourney."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"My second favorite movie EVER. Ripley is the Heroine every woman in movie/pop culture history (other then Princess Leia) wants to be. It's survival horror at it's grandest, it's just entertaining popcorn perfection."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Even better than the first, it's like the first was made just for this one. It's the action version of the first but also has just as many scares."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"A very different film than its predecessor, Aliens proves that taking a different road can sometimes be just what is fitting in a sequel"
1.0,1000617-aliens,Everything a sci-fi action movie should be.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"One of the greatest American films of the 1980's, ""Aliens"" captures and defines science fiction media."
1.0,1000617-aliens,Extended Director's Cut
1.0,1000617-aliens,Even better than the first one! This is one of the best science fiction movies ever! 5/5
1.0,1000617-aliens,My favorite film of all time...
1.0,1000617-aliens,Still one of the best if not THE best alien movie of all time.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"One of the most suspensful movies I've seen in my life; literally on the edge of my seat/yelling at the TV the entire movie. Great performance from Sigourny Weaver and easily the best in the series, took what was great about the first and improved on it!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Probably equal to the original, Aliens is an incredibly well done and entertaining action-horror film with a smart script and great performances."
1.0,1000617-aliens,Possibly the greatest film ever made. Superb!
1.0,1000617-aliens,"There are two kinds of people in the world; people who prefer the movie Alien to Aliens and people who prefer the movie Aliens to Alien. And you can't go wrong with that. Just add a lot of cool action and suspense, with a plural to make an awesome sequel."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Awesome movie. Very tense, very suspenseful, very action-packed, with an excellent performance from Weaver."
1.0,1000617-aliens,One James Cameron's best films and the best film in the alien saga Aliens is one of many sequels that is better than the first and the big difference is that this film is action packed.
1.0,1000617-aliens,One of my all time favorite movies! A must see for any horror fan!
1.0,1000617-aliens,By far the best of the Alien movies. Sigourney Weaver comes back from the first film with a powerful persona while still having a maternal sense about her when it comes to dealing with her crew and the little girl.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Next to Terminator 2, this just might be the best sequel ever made!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"New direction, huge amount of aliens coming at the same time, makes this movie great entertainment movie.And James' direction, strong script, and Sigourney's acting, this movie also succeeded to be great drama."
1.0,1000617-aliens,Brilliant from start to finish. An all time favourite
1.0,1000617-aliens,In space no-one can hear you scream. In the movie theatre everyone will. I think this is the best in the series as seeing so many aliens then the queen is such a thrilling concept. Even better on blu-ray with the inclusion of MUTHUR mode.
1.0,1000617-aliens,All you need in a movie.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"In drastic contrast to the classic original, Aliens is classic in its own way. And by that I mean this is an action packed, extremely tense, and awesome film!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,One of the most suspenseful films I've seen in quite some time.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"a sequel that actually develops the ideas from the first movie and doesn't just try to copy it. Cameron has made a few good films, this remains his greatest."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"best action movie ever made, and awsome effects. and the directing is great. but the girl so annoying when she screams but I would be screaming to if there was a alien in front of me lol"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Whereas 'Alien' was one of the best horror films ever, 'Aliens' is one of the best action movies ever made. With a terrific lead heroine, a great cast of memorable characters, and some excellent effects/action sequences, this is easily one of the best sequels ever made."
1.0,1000617-aliens,The Best Alien movie of all time.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Aliens is the epitome of what a sci-fi/action blockbuster should look, sound and feel like."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"What happens when you make a sequel to a highly praised film by completely changing the director and genre? You get Aliens, a visually incredible film, with a faster pace, more focus on war and action and one of the most memorable finales in any film."

1.0,1000617-aliens,Better than the first (Alien).
1.0,1000617-aliens,"I think people don't understand how much this movie influenced media now watching it 23 years after it released. It created the survival horror scenario seen in every movie and video game that game after it. Shear perfect tension, horror, and action. It is only bested by it's original."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"One of the best Sci-fi movies of all time! James Cameron as always turns the movies he directs into cinema gold. Everything and everyone that helped produce, star and create this movie deserves a full A+ rating. They dont make movies like this anymore!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,Hands down the BEST science-fiction action film of the 20th century. AMAZING VISUALS and TERRIFIC PERFORMANCES as well as CREEPY SUSPENSE MASTERY elevates James Cameron to the top of my (and I'm sure everybody else's) list of top notch directors.
1.0,1000617-aliens,its just perfect and brilliant. I'm at >150 viewings.

1.0,1000617-aliens,"Few films deserve a five star rating, but this is one of them. It's visually stunning, fantastically written, graced with some awesome actors, extremely intense, and nails both the action side of the story and the emotional one (between Newt and Ripley)."

1.0,1000617-aliens,"One of Cameron's best films, and a brilliant sequel to Alien, because it dared to do something different. i.e. Make a Vietnam film in space as opposed to the scary house style of the first. Ofcourse now it has been done to death, but Aliens stands the test of time."

1.0,1000617-aliens,"Aliens isn't exactly a suspensful horror film like Alien, but it is a darn good science fiction-action film. It does everything a sequel is supposed to do and does it well."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"If you want to make a good sequal, always have more guns. Guns and action. Guns and blood. More of what you feared in the first movie is what makes a great 2nd movie. More action, more people to get killed and a bigger area. This is what Aliens had and its what made it better than the first."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"With amazing action sequences, brilliant effects work, and a strong, multi-dimensional lead character, 'Aliens' is action filmmaking at its finest."

1.0,1000617-aliens,"One of the best sequel of all time! James Cameron went deeper into alien mythology and delivers not only a good horror movie, but also a pure action movie. And when you see the Alien Queen you know one thing - you will get away from her (bitch)!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,Ripley jumps from a monster horror flick to a balls-out action movie with such a fluid transition you barely notice it happened. Cameron is right at home and at the top of his game.

1.0,fantasia,"Best Disney film ever. The music is great, the animation is great, and the way they work together is great."
1.0,fantasia,A masterpiece in animation. A classic wonderful film that started Disney movies. Everyone should see this once In their lives period.
1.0,fantasia,Disney's masterpiece. It's set to music but it's hard not to love the animation no matter how old. The sorcerer and the brooms in a classic alone
1.0,fantasia,"Fantasia is imaginatively masterful blend of both the greatest music ever composed, and the greatest animation ever drawn."
1.0,fantasia,hats off to you Disney great job
1.0,fantasia,Favorite animated film of all-time.
1.0,fantasia,One of the greatest animated masterpieces of all-time.
1.0,fantasia,"Disney's true masterpiece!Without Fantasia, the music would be difficult to use for inspiration.Plus there's a splendid combination between live-action (hence the orchestra) and animation; Mickey Mouse shaking hands with the music conductor (epic!)"
1.0,fantasia,Excellent. Top-notch animation that's very vibrant and bursting with life that goes perfectly with the associated musical numbers.
1.0,fantasia,Music and magic:) I particularly enjoyed the Schubert piece.
1.0,fantasia,"A beautiful work of art. A bit odd/trippy at times, but just beautiful. Amazing visuals and music."
1.0,fantasia,one of my favorites. this was all done before CGI
1.0,fantasia,"Stunning and beautiful animation matches the music perfectly. While there is no concrete narrative, Fantasia doesn't need one as it is more along the lines of an experience than a traditional movie. An experience, I believe, that shouldn't be missed by any fan of animation or orchestra music."
1.0,fantasia,"Marvelous animation and wonderful music, a lovely mixture of the two"
1.0,fantasia,"Even at 71-years-old, Fantasia is a unique artistic experience that has yet to be properly duplicated. Walt Disney's one time failure has proven to be one of his biggest successes."

1.0,fantasia,The most memorable Disney classic in adaption to the classical music pieces ever composed by the world's famous composers.
1.0,fantasia,"Most likelly one of the best Disney have made, wich isnt trivial. So much feeling its given into this, like music the animation its there to be enjoyed and interpreted by each like a mini master work"
1.0,fantasia,All the music for films is on it.
1.0,fantasia,A must see Disney classic. You are not a Disney fan until you see this!
1.0,fantasia,"An amazing work of art that celebrates music and animation, creating short narratives that hold up better than most animation films today."
0.0,fantasia,"Not a fan. I dont see how its a good movie to watch. I dont know of any person who would even consciously say, hey you know what i havent seen in a while? Fantasia, lets do that to ourselves. Never. Blarghaflargh"
1.0,fantasia,I personally loved this film. I don't think you will enjoy on bit of it if you don't like artwork or music. I loved how they associated the film/ artwork in the same rythym with the music being played. It really bridged the gap between art and music.
1.0,fantasia,Chernabog (Satan) is the most compelling character of the entire film.
1.0,fantasia,Great visuals and Music 5 out of 5
1.0,fantasia,"I really liked this movie, because it is just great and soothing to listen to like it will always but you in a good mood. Also the colors and pictures are very cool too! They use classical music for this movie, like Bach. The first song they play gets kind of aggressive then goes soft."
1.0,fantasia,"Fantasia may not have any dialogue, but I have a feeling that that is what makes it great. The animation is over its head for the 1940s, and the music that accompanies the sequences is charming. This one is still perfect in my book."
1.0,fantasia,Stands on its own as a grand masterpiece. Still amazing.
0.0,fantasia,I extremely disliked this movie. The no talking was very boring and i was tired of the movie ten minutes after it started and then it was two hours long!
1.0,fantasia,"Ooh, Fantasia. Cna't deny this is a fine classic. I'd rate it lower, but this is one of Disney's biggest accomplishments,"
1.0,fantasia,This is what got me into classical music.

1.0,fantasia,Et la magie opÃ¨re dans ce long-mÃ (C)trage d'animation signÃ (C) Disney. Le 3Ã¨me du genre et le premier alliant si bien musique classique et narration.
1.0,fantasia,A true masterpiece in both the fields of music and animation. Definitely one of Disney's finest.
1.0,fantasia,A great mix of animation (traditional and from several different artists of the time) and classic music. An oddly inspiring piece of work that incorporates beauty and wonder.
1.0,fantasia,"This is, by far, one of Disney's best films of all time."
1.0,fantasia,"It's been said that Fantasia isn't as good for kids as much as it is for adults and nerdy kids. It's defiantly an acquired taste but never the less Fantasia is beautifully made movie with a unique strategy of storytelling, and in my opinion it is the best Disney movie ever made."
1.0,fantasia,This is the closest thing I've seen Disney do that transcends animation into the realm of art. It's real food for the soul stuff. And all of its small failures seem only to add shading and depth to the over all exquisiteness of the film.
1.0,fantasia,The best animated musical ever.
1.0,fantasia,Best Film when I was a child. This is just amazing
1.0,fantasia,music with visual effects in perfect harmony
1.0,fantasia,"An original, inventive, imaginative and creative experience that, found in only a handful of films, allows audiences to create their own interpretations of the images on screen and turn them into meaning. Beautiful, colourful and brilliant, its one of the first exercises in excess movies released."
1.0,fantasia,"Disney's best. It surprises me why films like 2001 and Fantasia (films with little dialogue) aren't common. I know audience have come to except speech in film, but the music gets by so much more and is fantastic."
1.0,fantasia,Ok...we need it with a new full digital recording.We also need another Fantasia in full 3d
1.0,fantasia,"A beautiful, colorful, animated movie with lovely music and excellent animation. 5 out of 5."

1.0,fantasia,"Definitely my favorite movie next to The Wizard of Oz, Fantasia has the sound and picture that captures audiences of all ages. With music pieces like The Sorcerer's Apprentice, The Dance of the Hours, and Ave Maria, this film is indeed one of Disney's best motion pictures if not the best."
1.0,fantasia,Arguably the best animated film of the 20th century.  Rating: Full Price

1.0,10_cloverfield_lane,Incredible thriller with a satisfying climax. Proved to be better than the first!
1.0,10_cloverfield_lane,It's great the way the movie plays with our mind making us wonder which hypothesis is true. The tension is very well worked out and the script is concerned with a lot of details (which is nice).
1.0,10_cloverfield_lane,One of the best movies I ever seen. What a gripping story!
0.0,10_cloverfield_lane,I don't even know if the movie was good or crap. It is nothing like the original.

1.0,10_cloverfield_lane,A perfect blend of mystery and thrill. John Goodman's performance is that of one of the best villians in film. The movie is connected to the first Cloverfield movie but to know exactly how you'll have to pay attention.

0.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,"A psychedelic waste pit of ugly UA animation, a song the only makes sense if you are on LSD, an bad acting."
1.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,"It's visuals may not be of the comprehension of some viewers (inluding me) but that can't remove the fact that Yellow Submarine is more than a musical, it's an authentic piece of art. Even many years after it's release, it has the same magic."
1.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,Endlessly inventive animation invigorates this tale of the Beatles saving a psychadelic fantasy land from a nasty horde of invaders. The images stagger the imagination and overall the film serves as the perfect complement to the Fab Four's late 60's material.
1.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,My favorite movie ever!
1.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,"""Yellow Submarine (1968)"" is one of the most imaginative and psychedelic animation films of all time, especially when you count the music of The Beatles."

1.0,iron_giant,A crowning masterpiece from Brad Bird right out of the gate. This gem was easily the last great American 2D animated film and should be hailed in the highest annals of the medium.
1.0,iron_giant,"I loved this. Had heard it was really good, but was released when I (born 1979) was too old to see this sort of thing at the cinema, so bought on DVD on the strength of the good news I'd heard about it, and was pleasantly surprised."
1.0,iron_giant,One of the greatest animated films of all time.Absolute masterpiece.

1.0,young_frankenstein,"It's hilarious, with timeless gags and and an insanely funny performance by Gene Wilder, but it's also a loving tribute to the golden age of horror."
1.0,young_frankenstein,Easily one of my favorite movies. Most people notice more gags after watching it several times I have found. Truly hilarious and dry humour that works very well.

1.0,marwencol,"Deeply touching is the story of Mark Hogancamp, the victim of an utterly despicable tragedy and now a unique artist. This movie strongly affected me. Everyone should see it."
1.0,marwencol,"hi dear friend, should really see this!"
1.0,marwencol,Just saw this today. Beautiful and inspiring movie.
1.0,marwencol,"Many people exploit awful experiences, but this film seemed very genuine. It seemed as if Hogancamp inspired this movie, and didn't request it to be made. It was both sad and funny. I suggest seeing it if it is available to you."
1.0,marwencol,Excelente e inspirador documentario
1.0,marwencol,Pure and utter genius.
1.0,marwencol,"Not only was this movie beautifully made, it was compassionate and present to Mark Hogancamp's experience all the way to the end. No spoiler alert in the trailer either, which is refreshing. This movie is Oscar bound imho."

1.0,nosferatu,This is one the scariest movie ever. IT has great acing. it also a great story line.
1.0,nosferatu,Classic Absolute without more.
1.0,nosferatu,Best 1st of the classic monsters even Coppola can't remake but he did a good job the original is far more creepy
1.0,nosferatu,"Horror movies ground zero, I know Caligari came first, but nothing beats an old horror character. One of the best silent movies I have ever seen, the film have an erie mood with a painting kind of impression, making the horror experience even better."
1.0,nosferatu,Great Movie. One of the best.
1.0,nosferatu,"A classic movie introducing many filming techniques used in horror to this day. This movie also has a swapped gender role story line, which is very far ahead of its time. All together, it is an important movie in its themes and its cinematography."
1.0,nosferatu,"A true gothic story, Nosferatu is full of eeriness and has a chilling performance from Max Shreck"
1.0,nosferatu,"10 out of 10:Nosferatu may be a silent film, but it still manages to be creepy with its great set design and makeup and a nice feel."
1.0,nosferatu,"i'm pretty sure the simply fact that a 16 year old boy in 2016 genuinely enjoys this film, i DEFINITELY a good sign"
1.0,nosferatu,"One of the best films of all time, it was a master piece shot in the style of German Expressionism. It utilised several techniques such as stop motion and foreshadowing. The story itself was a loose adaptation of Dracula though the creepy effect is still haunting even till today."
1.0,nosferatu,"It is incontestably a historical piece of cinema, the birth of the vampire in popular culture as well as a great example of the German Expressionist moviment. A classic of the classics. 5/5 stars"
1.0,nosferatu,"This timeless horror classic is scary, but enjoyable to watch and is better than lots of horror films today. I could watch this a thousand times and it would still be creepy. This masterpiece has great music, great actors, and it lives up to its eeriness to this day."
1.0,nosferatu,Went to see it with my boyfriend and they had a live band playing for the sound. It was amazing!
0.0,nosferatu,although I highly respect it as it's probably the first ever horror movie and it was extremely groundbreaking I personally found it quite boring and not enjoyable
1.0,nosferatu,"Nosferatu is a classic Horror-film, with iconic scenes and one of the best Horror-movie antagonists. Nosferatu is a great film with a good tragic ending, and deserves five stars."
1.0,nosferatu,"Classic horror, the first vampire film."
1.0,nosferatu,"One of the finest of the silent era, Nosferatu remains an influence to the horror genre thanks to its gritty feel and creepy performance by Max Schreck that still delivers some chills even after many years!!!"
1.0,nosferatu,"I used to be scared by his face as a kid. I grew out of that and now I realize that its a great movie and its legitimately creepy, especially for the time"
1.0,nosferatu,beats the hell out of alot of movies nowadays
1.0,nosferatu,Shrek's terrifying disposition as Nosferatu adds a whole new layer of horror. Murnau is in top form as always. The visuals and tight structure are to be revered and are frequently mimicked in modern horror with good reason.
1.0,nosferatu,Stephanie Meyer needs to watch this!!
1.0,nosferatu,"Amazingly eerie and frighteningly alive despite the limitations of this silent era of filming. I am a lover of all things horror, and this movie fit the bill very well. The creepiness of Nosferatu still works even in 2014, where there is a high standard for horror."
1.0,nosferatu,"90+ years old and still the best version of *coughs* Dracula to date - startling use of shadows and negative photography, and Max Shrek is still bloody terrifying!"
1.0,nosferatu,very cool to see something that old.
1.0,nosferatu,"Wonderfully acted and hauntingly shot, Murnau's horror epic still retains its power nearly 100 years (!) after it was made. Hilariously, considering the circumstances under which it was made, it also might be the best film adaption of ""Dracula"" to date."
1.0,nosferatu,"It's a classic, what's not to love."
1.0,nosferatu,"Schreck plays the eponymous vampire with an almost savage simplicity, and teamed with Murnau's striking and frightful visual storytelling created some of cinema's most lasting and haunting imagery. While not out and out terrifying, Nosferatu is eerily spooky and chilling."
1.0,nosferatu,One of the greatest horror films of all time.
1.0,nosferatu,I Loved It! I've always Wanted to see it and I Personally Love Max Shreck's Creepy Performance! Its Hard To Believe that He was one of those Actors that couldn't get out of character! Fantastic!

1.0,nosferatu,"Creepy, beautiful and groundbreaking."
1.0,nosferatu,A true classic of the silent era
1.0,nosferatu,"It's the one that started it all. Five stars in the bank. Of course, I have to admit that this was just a bit more enjoyable watching in the context of John Malcovich's and Willem Dafoe's wonderful interpretation, ""Shadow of the Vampire""."
1.0,nosferatu,95% The makeup for Nosferatu is astounding for a film this old.
1.0,nosferatu,Bram Stoker's Dracula in a German silent film with Hans Erdmann doing the score is the ideal combination for instant horror success. Vampire culture meets the big screen for the first time in this historic gem. Look for this online as it will be hard to find.
1.0,nosferatu,"I think it's incredible how this film can truly scare without the use of any sound. The German Expressionist sets are great as well. The iconic use of shadow is great. This was the first silent film I ever saw, and it was an excellent experience."

1.0,nosferatu,"Easily one of the most memorable horror films from the silent era, Nosferatu is one of the greatest adaptions of Bram Stoker's Dracula - even if it wasn't technically legally adapted - especially thanks to Schreck's unforgettably frightening performance as the vampire himself."
1.0,nosferatu,"The classic 1922 vampire that created a memorial film genre is amazing with the directorial work of F.W. Murnau, and Max Schreck's performance as Count Orlok."

1.0,wings_of_desire,Wim Wender's offers his audience something of a lesson in Berlin's pyscho-geography alongside perhaps the most haunting protrayl of angels in film.
1.0,wings_of_desire,A stunningly simple yet beautiful film.

1.0,wings_of_desire,"Again, Wim Wenders. Great."
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Wim Wenders has such a unique style. He had the visuals down in Paris, Texas, but he really nail everything with this. Very poetic. Whenever I find myself describing this film to someone, I almost want to cry."
1.0,wings_of_desire,good movie and very physiological but few years later Hollywood had to made a remake with Nicolas cage and meg Ryan
1.0,wings_of_desire,Needless to say it haunts more and more at every new viewing.

1.0,wings_of_desire,One of the most beautiful German movies I have ever seen!
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Wim Wenders finds means to say something that could not have been siad otherwise. It's a film about material, immaterial and the relationship in between."
1.0,wings_of_desire,I'd give up forever to touch you.
1.0,wings_of_desire,"The sequence with the author & thinker walking through Berlin, thinking about the damaged city along with the love vested in the color portion with the trapeze dancer are two points of extremely distinct grace that are surprising to find in one film."
1.0,wings_of_desire,Best movie EVER. Fact.

1.0,wings_of_desire,AWESOME.X2 quite possibly the best film ever.
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Columbo is the spawn of seraphim. Also, one of the best New Wave movies I've seen."
1.0,wings_of_desire,"""Las alas del deseo"". Una de las formas más geniales de mostrar el alma de un país fue esta, sin duda... Inefable."
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Really quite astounding, ethereal and profound. And Peter Falk... incredibly charming."
1.0,wings_of_desire,"one of those films that's so beautiful and thought provoking. Makes you look at life from another angle. Not ment for ""easy entertainment"" but this is a masterpiece."
1.0,wings_of_desire,"AÈ(TM)a filme nu existÄ. Wim Wenders rrrupe (È(TM)i Nick Cave, È(TM)i Peter Falk) È(TM)i suie rrrepede pe piedestal alÄturi de Jarmusch & Co."
1.0,wings_of_desire,Simply 1 of the greatest movies of all time!

1.0,wings_of_desire,A truly amazing piece of cinema.
1.0,wings_of_desire,Fantastisk! Betongpornografi.
0.0,wings_of_desire,"This is the dumbest movie I've ever seen. I turned it off after 20 minutes of ""dummes, belangloses Zeug"". I'm not interested in hearing people's inner thoughts or to angels speak calmly about ""becoming humans""."
1.0,wings_of_desire,possibly my favorite all time film
1.0,wings_of_desire,watched this yet again last night because i just recently got it on criterion collection blu-ray. among the greatest ever.
1.0,wings_of_desire,"In many ways, the finest film of the 80's...perhaps ever."
1.0,wings_of_desire,i love this movie it so good
0.0,wings_of_desire,"Apparently, this is a classic. I actually fell asleep whilst watching it and woke up to find - to my disappointment- that it was still on. A shame, as Wender's 'Paris Texas' is one of my favourite films."
1.0,wings_of_desire,A very moving elegy about the yearnings of all of the inhabitants in a divided world. It's also one of the most truly romantic films I seen in how an angel is willing to give up his wings and immortality to be with the woman he loves. A film that truly stays with you.
1.0,wings_of_desire,The true value of the gift of humanity is both a sadness and a joy. (Wim Wenders is quickly becoming one of my new favorite filmmakers.)
1.0,wings_of_desire,Its film or poetry? I never felt this feeling before.........thank you Wenders
1.0,wings_of_desire,"It's not a film for everyone. Too artsy for some and too slow for others, but if you give it a chance, you're in for one of the finest films from any country, in any language. I didn't get into it at first, but once I started to understand this world of angels, it really started to grab me."
1.0,wings_of_desire,its an out of the world movie!! an outstanding experience!!
1.0,wings_of_desire,My all-time favorite film.
1.0,wings_of_desire,i say only one thing: scene in library!
1.0,wings_of_desire,A grand reunification tale.
1.0,wings_of_desire,Very few scenes ever captivated me more than watching the late Solveig Dommartin swinging herself with such enchantment in the trapeze while being watched by an angel in black and white.
1.0,wings_of_desire,Not so much a movie as it is a visual experience. It takes a director with real talent to create real emotions without having to use dialogue. Wim Wenders is that talent.
1.0,wings_of_desire,"beautiful film with a beautiful story, beautiful cinematography, beautiful words, beautiful style, and beautiful scenes.,Why am I me and why not you? Why am I here watching this movie and why not there doing something else? sure god couldn't have been more nicer to me.."
1.0,wings_of_desire,"a beautiful, mesmerising, haunting, lovely, poetic film that captivates you from the start. Bruno Ganz is perfect as the Angel who falls in love with a mortal.  Peter Falk adds an extra dimension - a great addition to the film."
1.0,wings_of_desire,Just saw this on the big screen for the first time. Love it.
1.0,wings_of_desire,This film is indescribable. Just reading the director's original pitch barely does the film justice. It has to be experienced.
1.0,wings_of_desire,"One of my all-time favorites. It's definitely the sort film that has to be watched without distraction and if you are looking to be spoon-fed a storyline, I'd keep looking. It's the sort of film that drifts, leaving it up to you to follow along."
0.0,wings_of_desire,The German version of City of Angels. I skipped and forwarded my way through it. Some poignant moments and I do understand what they were trying to do. I like the fact that it makes you feel for the struggles of mankind without the sappy ending.
1.0,wings_of_desire,Second best movie of all history
1.0,wings_of_desire,If I ever see this again I'm sure I will like it even more. The arthouse style is not that familiar to me so it took some time to get used to the pacing and style. The only thing that bothered me was Marion's monologue in the end. Seemed misplaced a bit.
1.0,wings_of_desire,the closest i've seen film come to poetry
1.0,wings_of_desire,"""Las alas del deseo"" Una hermosísima película de Win Wenders; la primera parte de ""Tan cerca, tan lejos""."
1.0,wings_of_desire,The germans know how to make gooood films

1.0,wings_of_desire,a sweet analysis of human complexity
1.0,wings_of_desire,"It's one of those films that is both artsy AND really cool. It even has a Nick Cave cameo. It was remade into City of Angels, only with all the cool stuff removed."
1.0,wings_of_desire,Beautiful. Achingly beautiful. All elements of this movie come together and present a wonderful celebration of life and all the little simple great things about it.
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Formidable, magnifico, an fear and any other words that come to mind in any country."
1.0,wings_of_desire,A haunting and atmospheric masterpiece. This film gets you into the head of an angel. It really makes you rethink all of the glorious little details of life. I loved it.
1.0,wings_of_desire,noch einmal: so schÃ¶n!
1.0,wings_of_desire,I cringed when this got remade with Nicolas Cage in it. One of my all time favorites.

1.0,wings_of_desire,"where else i have write review in Flixter ? i wrote many about this masterpiece , even and the small passing of Nick Cave . i own the soundtrack ....what happened ?"
1.0,wings_of_desire,The rancid gash from Meg Ryan and Niicholas Cage in the re-make was an insult...

1.0,wings_of_desire,Beautiful. Moving. Unique. Impressive.
1.0,wings_of_desire,"And elegiac masterpiece about as simple and complex a subject as what it means to exist in time, or, essentially, what is to be human. A film so rich that one viewing could never do it justice. Brilliant."
1.0,wings_of_desire,One of the great poetic experiences in the history of the cinema!
1.0,wings_of_desire,"sorti en France sous le nom : ""Les Ailes du DÃ©sir"" ! Par le meilleur film avec le lieutenant Columbo ! (pourrait s'intituler ""Columbo et le mur de Berlin"")"

1.0,wings_of_desire,Peter Falk is cooler than the Fonz in Wim Wender's materpiece
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Lo mejor de todo es la lentitud con que Wim Wenders muestra lo sienten y piensan los personajes. Y despuÃ©s de mostrarlo cuenta, tambiÃ©n sin prisa, lo que quiere contar."
1.0,wings_of_desire,"one of the greates movies i've seen in my life , it's a a pleasure for your eyes, for your soul , and obviously only one director was able to create this , Wim Wenders !!!"

1.0,wings_of_desire,One of my top ten films. Beautiful story.
1.0,wings_of_desire,"es impresionante la mirada de Wenders acerca de la humanidad, de la vida en sÃ­ misma .... su cine es muestra de un cariÃ±o por los pequeÃ±os detalles y las grandes casualidades. Lo dice todo con ""Ich weiss jetst, was kein Engel weiss""... una oda a la vida"

1.0,wings_of_desire,"Its hard to explain, but this film was great. It just grabs you and pulls you into this world. A very poetic, thought-provoking, hypnotic film experience."
1.0,wings_of_desire,A beautiful film. The constant camera movements capture a sureal and unearthly character which was perfect for the film. Nothing about the black and white to colour and back feels trite. Everything about it works in every way. Could have easily been boring but instead is pure genius.
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Es ist nicht die Romantik des Films Ich liebe die meistenEs ist die Art, wie sie kÃ¶nnen eine Verbindung mit Menschen und wie sie erreichtMenschen Gedanken"
1.0,wings_of_desire,"If you have seen this movie and don't love it, you're an ignorant douche."
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Best movie I've ever seen... petry in every word ...When the child was a child, it didnâ??t know that it was a child, everything was soulful, and all souls were one."
1.0,wings_of_desire,One of my all-time favorite films!
1.0,wings_of_desire,"I don't believe that he wanted to be a human only because of her. It was also because of colors, scents ... But in fact, I don't like it only because of the film itself, but rather because of some kind of personal reasons."
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Deep happiness. My best viewing was at the premiere in Copenhagen, where the film was subtitled with *three* lines in stead of two. The best translation of the poetic core I have seen."
1.0,wings_of_desire,difficult to have one favorit film... but this is one of the best I've seen.

1.0,wings_of_desire,Beautiful and subtle

1.0,wings_of_desire,This film was amazing on some many levels: the writing was poetic without being maudlin; the cinematography was amazing and the characters had such life. It truely felt what a great film should be about.
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Essential Viewing.  One of the most beautiful films ever made. Wings of Desire isn't so much a movie you watch, as an artwork you experience."

1.0,wings_of_desire,"I was personally dazzled by the ending and the reason was the scene was one of a kind. I cannot put words into it but looking at it, I was hypnotized by it.

1.0,wings_of_desire,"Para mi, el mejor filme jamas creado; el poema de lo que significa ser humano, ante los ojos de un angel. Es el concepto original de ""City of Angels""."

1.0,wings_of_desire,Nick Cave was a nice surprise oh and it was a beautiful film
1.0,wings_of_desire,"I love this movie--it's moving and surreal and City of Angels is only superficially a ""remake"" of it. Los Angeles is not a stand-in for Berlin at the eve of the fall of the wall."
1.0,wings_of_desire,"This is the best film ever - haven't seen it in 10 years, but it still plays in my head and heart"
1.0,wings_of_desire,Please See this Cindy!

1.0,wings_of_desire,"One of THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FILMS EVER MADE. I watched this in my German class when I was 15 and it still haunts me. The dialogue is so beautiful written, it's so delicately crafted, yet incredibly passionate."
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Bruno Ganz as an inquisitive angel, perhaps, but Peter Falk? What is this German fasination with Colombo????"
1.0,wings_of_desire,Bruno Ganz and Peter Falk at their best - being immortal has its drawbacks...
1.0,wings_of_desire,Beautiful ...beautiful. Hope -

1.0,wings_of_desire,"A fascinatingly inscrutable parable...in this movie you will be a bystander, looking through a window, with your own thoughts and ideas a part of the movie, not the other way around. If you're not ready to go there, don't bother watching."
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Admittedly have not seen this since it came out, but I remember loving it then"
1.0,wings_of_desire,If I crashed on a deserted island and managed to save the DVD reader this is the movie I wish to have with me!
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Yep. Still love it. Still love Peter Falk, still love Wim Wenders, still love it. Even the long talkey scenes. And the DVD has the deleted pie fight scene, which even cracks Wenders up. That's worth the price of admission alone."
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Great cinematography especially in the library (is that me being biased?) and Nick Cave crops up in it, and columbo. Prefer the black and white but thats just me. Going to watch to Faraway so close soon despite its u2 connections."

1.0,being_john_malkovich,This movie propelled Charlie Kaufman into the limelight - intense characters and a whimsical premise. Sometimes it is the oddest stories which highlight the human condition best. Surreal. Must watch for any film buff.

1.0,being_john_malkovich,"A supremely well-crafted, thought-provoking narrative."
1.0,being_john_malkovich,"If there is a category called philosophical comedy, this is it. It's about a puppeteer finding a portal that takes him into the mind of the actor John Malkovich. It has it's laugh out loud moments and moments of genius. Thoroughly enjoyed the movie..and Catherine Keener !"

1.0,being_john_malkovich,"Boosted by Charlie Kaufman's supremely original and clever script, along with great performances and stylish direction by Spike Jonze, ""Being John Malkovich"" is one of the strangest, oddest yet astoundingly clever comedy I've seen in quite a long time. Could be a potential all-time favorite, too!"
1.0,being_john_malkovich,Being john malkovich has to be one of the most original and oustanding film experinece out there.For my money this film has a wondeful cast that are all right for there roles.This film is one of the most fascinating masterpieces ever made.

0.0,being_john_malkovich,I have no idea why I sat through the whole thing. It was just weird. It had an interesting ending but the whole thing was just really weird. I'd put it right up there with Donnie Darko and Sunshine of the Spotless Mind... movies that I just didn't understand.

1.0,being_john_malkovich,The most imaginative script i have seen so far!

1.0,being_john_malkovich,"John Cusack's best movie, Cameron Diaz' best movie, John Malkovic's best movie. I'm usually into more realistic cinema, but I had a lot of fun with this movie. Spike Jonze is a great storyteller."
1.0,being_john_malkovich,"Sort of like Facebook... Catherine Keener was very good, I am getting to like her in movies more and more. She is good as a supportting actress. I also did not recognize Cameron Diaz, so she can play more than a sexual plaything."
1.0,being_john_malkovich,"Easily one of the strangest movies I've ever seen, but you don't doubt the world or the characters for a second. When Cameron Diaz proclaims she wants a penis, AND a vagina, I didn't even blink."
1.0,being_john_malkovich,"Though the title seems kind of dated by today's standards (no offense against Malkovich) but the movie still delivers the quirky, off beat goods and that is what counts. Imaginative and very entertaining."

1.0,being_john_malkovich,"It's just so original. At first glance you would think the story would be lifeless and boring, but it is just truly amazing how a far out idea can be developed so well. Malkovich is simply awesome and Cusack is very good. Catherine Keener is a fox in this btw."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"I would have liked more screen time for the actual bride, but BOF manages to surpass the first film in some areas."

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,The Bride of Frankenstein has been deemed one of the greatest horror sequels as it improves a lot from the original from effects to character
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,A true Horror classic. Make a point to see it. Very scary.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Sad and frightening, Karloff's performance is unnerving in its deep longing for purpose and understanding in a world that hates him for simply existing."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Good Movie Good Classic
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,The greatest sequel of all time.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"This James Whale masterpiece just gets better with each viewing. Every facet of the movie, from script, direction, acting, score, cinematography, and production, is world class. Not to be missed."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,A monster and his beloved dead bride!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"One of those rare sequels that is actually worthy of its predecessor. Karloff returns as the monster, and Clive as Frankenstein. Karloff adds more personality to the Monster, while Clive reluctantly obliges his monster with a Bride. A fantastic, simple, yet original work of cinematic art."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"James Whale's Bride of Frankenstein is surely even more odd, over-the-top, visually exciting, and terrifying than its 1935 release, because we are more conscious of its undertones of macabre and violation."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"5/5 * Possible better than its predecessor, The Bride of Frankenstein advances upon its themes while being all the better frightening."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Campy and delightful, ""The Bride of Frankenstein"" introduces humanity (and possibly homosexuality?) to the previously evil monster to fantastic results."

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the few sequels that i loved more than the original.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Awesome in every way!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,The very best of the Universal Horror films.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"A wonderful, cinematic feat as beautiful in its visual presentation as it is in its touching tale of the human condition as represented by Dr. Frankenstein's repulsive monster, who has become more 'human' than in the first installment."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"With spectacular visuals, a great villain, and the monster being able to talk, Bride of Frankenstein is undeniably superior to the original."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Just one word CLASSIC
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the few sequels to really surpass the first film on all levels. James Whale's use of tracking shots and self parody are really ahead of its time which makes this film feel timeless in a sense.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,My third favorite film of all time. Everything about this movie is fantastic.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"This is the perfect example of a great film. The symbolism, Art Direction, acting, directing, and score is nothing short of pure perfection. This sequel is better than the original film. We really get to know the Monster better than ever."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,one of my favorite 'sequels' ever same director same cast and oh those silver streaks in elsa lanchester's hair.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"It's great! Although, it's more about Frankenstein than his bride; and it ends rather strangely."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Although not a horror film, this movie is one of the best films from the 30s. Holds up EXCEPTIONALLY well."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,seen it & own it! =0)
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"This movie is amazing. It combines comedy, parody, horror, and drama together in the right combination. The era when the movie came out helps a lot too. Multiple/mix genre like this wouldn't fly today."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Shows how man is the true monster.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,It really IS as good as they say.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,A sequel that surpasses the original. Boris Karloff was a woefully underrated actor. He gave the Frankenstein Monster such a gravitas thatno other actor who has essayed the role has ever come close to matching.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"A definite great movie. The only problem is that you only see The Bride for 2 minutes, then the movie ends... What?"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Alone: Bad. Friend: Good!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,For me better than the first.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"I LOVE the opening. What a way to allow for a sequel when the first seemed over and done with. A little more of a comedy, a little more of a horror, lots more energy and style than the first film. And what an ending! ""WE BELONG DEAD!"""
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,The absolute best film of its era and genre.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Probably the first sequel to be clearly better than the first.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"My favorite classic horror movie by far. Enough has been said about this movie over the years that I can't add anything more. If you haven't seen this, and you love classic cinema, this is a must see."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"I was no older than 10 when I saw this, and I had such a crush on Elsa Lanchester (I know, you don't have to say it)."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,your wife hates you get drunk with a blind guy!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,The monster smokes dope
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Its incredible how well James Whale's horror classic has aged. The greatest Frankenstein movie made is technically astonishing even to this day and Boris Karloff is both frightening and emotionally touching as Frankenstein's monster. Perhaps the greatest universal horror movies ever made.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,The best horror film ever made! Astonishing performances by Karloff and Clive! The reviving of the bride is one of the most memorable scenes in the history of horror films.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"This is a great sequel! I love that it, to me, has some comedic lines. Or maybe its just my brain because I LOVE Young Frankenstein? :)))"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,This movie does the impossible multiple times. It makes the monster into an endearing character. The movie makes you feel for the murdering mix of dead bodies. And most of all: it expands and exceeds the original. One of Universal's best!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,This was strangely magical and creepy with a heart hidden within itself.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"awsome, just awsomne!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"A true classic. Even better than the original. Ernst Thesiger practically steals the show with his flamboyant and macabre Dr. Pretorius. A must see, if not own, for any true horror fan."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Perfect! She's alive,she's alive...."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Alone, bad... Friend, good..."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the best Frankenstein movies ever.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"A Fantastic film. The Monster is more present in this film and is very enjoyable to watch. Boris will always be the best Frankenstein as far as I'm concerned. Elsa Lanchester is very Haunting and beautiful as the bride, yet her hissing is very eerie. If you love Horror movies this is a must see."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"I actually really liked it. The special effects were extremely impressive for 1936, Boris Karloff did an amazing job as The Monster, supporting actors and other roles were great actors,and the scene with the blind man for some reason really touched me. The whole friend idea I guess. I reccommend."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Really is one of the greatest movies of all time. Deserves to be among the ranks of Citizen Kane or Sunset Boulevard.

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One Of The Worlds Greatest Horror/Thriller Movies!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"fantastic film - possibly better than original, shows more brutality than the original and more character development. A superb masterpiece of early cinema"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Another one of those rare sequels that outshine their predecessors. Also directed by James Whale 'The Bride of Frankenstein' manages to delve deeper into the characters from the original film. Again Karloff gives his all as the Creature who longs for acceptance.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"About as brilliant as a sequel can get. Great story, interesting characters, beautiful music, and the performances by the actors are amazing. Bride of Frankenstein is a true cinematic Masterpiece."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"This is definately my favorite of the sereis. Clive and Karloff bothe give great preformances and makes you feel for the characters, even the monster. dr. Pretoreous is one of the best villains on screen and possibley the best mad doctor portrayed in a motion picture. check it out cause its epic."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"The best of the Universal monster movies. Bride is that rare sequel that, after viewing, feels like an essential companion to the original, the other half to complete the story. It's also truer to the book (a little), and just incredibly satisfying all around."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"The Bride of Frankenstein is just as great as the original, but this time around, we feel for the monster."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Personal favorite. I love this movie. ""To a new world of gods and monsters!"""

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,I love this film so much!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Clive and Karloff continue to own their respective roles. This time Elsa Lanchester is along for the ride and adds something special. I'd actually argue that this is superior to the original Frankenstein.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"As classic as Whale's Frankenstien is, his sequel is even better. A true masterpiece and one of the crown jewels in the Universal classic monster series!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"just like its predecessor, classic"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Iâ(TM)d have to say all of the Universal Frankensteins held to a marvelously entertaining standard. Yes. Even âFrankenstein Meets Wolfman.â?  The humor James Whale injected into this one was quite a risk, but it came of beautifully, only increasing our sympathies for The Monster."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Yes. This is how you make a movie. Fantastic characters all around and insanely good lines.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Despite the fact that people will inevitably compare and contrast this with the original 1931 Frankstein, this is a different, pardon the pun, beast. Bride of Frankenstein is characterised by the camp and hammy performances of Ernst Thesiger and Una O'Connor and a sly, dark sense of humour."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Absolutely the best Frankenstein movie ever.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the very few sequels which improves on the first film. This is a blackly comic horror.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"This was the last of the great Universal horror films...after this, Universal took a downward trend into cheap camp, and the bright spots for the next 20 years were few and far in-between."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"More emotionally powerful than it has any right to be, ""Bride"" forever destroys the idea that a sequel is always inferior. Great emotion, iconic imagery, and even visual effects, are what make this widely considered one of the greatest thrillers ever put to film."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Director James Whale once again creates another great Frankenstein movie. As a sequel, the movie sticks a little more truthfully to the book and manages to give the monster a voice. A strange and at times funny film."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the best horror films ever made. A classic of the 1930s.

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"It takes everything that works in the first Frankenstein and improves it.

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,a highly entertaining film. a sequel which is better than the original. it had a bigger budget and it is obvious. sets are huge. there are more storylines. everything is much more complex. it is even funny at times. plus its tense and exciting. and beautifully filmed. classic.

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Atmospheric, campy and just plain fun to watch. I love the whole 7 film Frankenstein series released by Universal in the 30's and 40's but this one is my favortite. This, the second in the series, was the last one directed by James Whale."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Some say this is better than the first one, it's definitely a close one. More science fiction is thrown in with the black magic dr. and his miniature people, it's kinda weird but that's the only part I have a problem with, everything else is great!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"One of the great horror films, is also a biting satire of love and acceptance. Lonely guy wants to meet a nice girl, he gets two doctors to create her and she rejects him. But that's how it goes in life. The ugly guy will always be rejected by the girl for the good looking doctor."

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,My favorite horror movie ever made. possibly my favorite movie of all time.It is one of the most beautiful movies ever made. the set design and musical score are amazing and the cast is first rate.

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Excellent sequel that's on par and even better than the first.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Better than FRANKENSTEIN on every level, Whale and Karloff seem to have grown into their roles with this franchise. Has yet to be surpassed (Fuck that DeNiro piece of crap)"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"I guess you could say this film is the Godfather Pt. 2 of horror. Its one of the very few horror sequels that manages to be better than the original. Don't get me wrong James Whale's Frankenstein is an absolute classic, but this one is better."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Oh please, if this isn't one of the greatest horror movies ever!"

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Otra prueba de que las segundas partes pueden superar al original. Mas diversion, mas subtexto, mas momentos inolvidables. Esta es la pelicula definitiva de la serie de Frankenstein."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Dr. Pretorius is so much scarier than Karloff in this. We feel so much more sympathy for the monster in this one and there are some very clever special effects. The best Frankenstein film I've seen.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,This is a good movie
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"One of the first extremely subversive horror films. A true Masterpiece. James Whale is a genius, he made one of maybe two films that showcased the brilliance of Mary Shelly's book."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Not just a great horror movie, this is great film, period. Weird and delightful."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Easily the best of the classic monster movies! This film took everything that worked in the first and built onto it a really moving and at times tear-jerking cinematic experience. This film is amoungst my top 10 favorite films of all time!

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Boris Karloff does it again with his great performance in this classic.

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,A masterpiece that is absolutely timeless and needs no further introduction or words.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"De toda una saga, de toda una epoca, la joya maxima de los estudios Universal."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"to the untrained eye this film simply reaffirms social norms and values, but it is subtly coded with subversive critiques of race, gender, and sexuality. i'm not saying the hollywood censorship codes were a good thing, but they certainly forced filmmakers to become much more clever."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"A very fun time. Some honestly wonderful special effects, too."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"An absolute classic! Really. To have created this film in 1931 is astounding. It's short and sharp, just like all those good, old films, and it's truly poignant at times. A must-see for lovers of b-grade horror and the like ;->"
0.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Bride of Frankenstein 2/10 Bring back the original characters and staying true to the original is not enough to save this movie. A complete downfall to the first, because it seemed like they rushed through making this script."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"This film was highly impressive for the time in which it was created... actually, it's fairly impressive now! And Boris Karloff is the ONLY Frankenstein's monster for me!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the few horror films that is considered a classic outside of its own genre. James Whale broke all the rules and pushed the envelope as far as was possible in 1935. Brilliant.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,I find this movie scary and disturbing. It sucks that smomeone had to die in order to create life. the reasoning behind that is sickening
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"James Whale totally outdid himself, it's one of the 100 best movies ever made. An artistic triumph!"

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"The greatest gothic horror film of all time. The jewel in the crown of Universal's classic monster movies. Spooky, atmospheric, touching, you name it, it's in here. Only an actor like Boris Karloff could have made this monster sympathetic. A great, great film."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Brilliant. Dr. Frankenstein's trying to get out but Dr. Praetorious keeps dragging him back! btw, this is a tremendous step in the development of ""the sequel."" Whale and his cohorts were wise enough to grow the world, rather than remake the first picture..."

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Yes, it is better than Frankenstein."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,A masterpiece that amazes even today.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"James Whale's masterpiece genre film. This film is remarkable, not only because of it's stunning black and white cinematography, but also for it's heart, whimsy and influence. This is the film that Tim Burton aspires to make. It won't happen."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Oh, I love this movie. It's perfect."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,A rare case where the sequel is better. One of three classic Frankenstein tales.

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Very rarely does a sequel supercede the life before it. This one does and in spades.  Oh, and Dr. Pretorius is a great character."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Elsa Lanchester is perfect as the bride. Her reaction to the monster, and his reaction to her, is tragic."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Un classique. Cette suite est encore mieux que le premier Ã©pisode (1931). Une somptueuse photo en noir et blanc, un monstre on ne peut plus convaincant et une histoire qui n'a pas pris une ride. Ã? voir."

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,better than the original. The human portrayal of the monster is my favorite aspect of this movie.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Even better than the original. James Whale's sequel is a great, great movie. The Bride is amazing of course, even though you see her only briefly, and there's a lot more humor than the first movie. Amazing movie."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Sometimes I have wondered whether life wouldn't be more amusing if we were all devils, and no nonsense about angels and being good."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Even though The Bride has very little camera time I find myself enchanted by the last few minutes of this film anyway. The rest of it is alright but the 5 stars go to the last few powerful minutes that Elsa shines in*
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Probably one of the first and best SEQUELS of all time. Great film.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Better than the first in my opinion. Sad as hell.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the few occassions that a sequel is better than the original. I also like how Whale took elements from Shelley's original work and inocrporated it into this film.

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"A great classic, not really spooky as funny, though"

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Creepy and atmospheric, this movie is fantastically entertaining."

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Very odd. But at the same time very good. Universal never had a flop with horror films in the 30's.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Classic Universal Horror. This one is the best of the three Karloff films, which is saying a lot. There'e a bit of whimsey here, but it's dark, brooding and fun. The Bride is devastating and the monster SPEAKS!"

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"I saw one scene: the final one. I take its memory out and fondle it every half moon. Knocked me on my ass. Beautiful. Walesevolved expressionism into the horror genre. I am a pedant, a monster far worse than Boris Karloff any day."

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the few sequels ever to surpass it's original in everyway!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Arguably better than the original Frankenstein, The Mummy and Dracula, James Whale's second Frankenstein picture is a masterpiece of gothic horror. As re-animated babes go, Elsa Lanchester's ""Bride"" is hot as blazes. Too bad she didn't feel the same about Karloff's ""Monster"". A perfect film."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Tops the original in every way and may be the best damn horror film of all time. There's just so much entertainment value here, it's incredible."

1.0,looper,Good movie. Can watch over and over again
0.0,looper,"An awful, pointless movie with a ridiculously unbelievable, flawed plot. A gimmick, don't waste your time."
1.0,looper,A modern classic. Takes time travel to a whole new level.
1.0,looper,"Amazing thriller with a fitting end. Smart, funny, and entertaining from beginning to end."
1.0,looper,...........well......that was depressing.
1.0,looper,the new holy grail of sci-fi
0.0,looper,"What is everyone so excited about? Great filming and cutting, but this story is terrible and worthless, plenty predictable with its weak twists and uninteresting curves. The ending so many are excited about is not complex and painfully predictable."
1.0,looper,top time travel action thriller!
1.0,looper,One of the best modern science fiction movies. The symmetry of the film is nearly as beautiful as its character arcs.
1.0,looper,"Really good movie. Great action and effects, great story. Wonderful surreal entertainment. One of the best of the year in terms of pure fun and goofy situations and weird paradoxes. It was a pretty rad movie with a spectacular story and even more spectacular action scenes. Stunning."
1.0,looper,"Sure the time travel is wonky, but the movie is great none the less."
1.0,looper,"One of my favorite Sci-fi movies in recent years. Though decisions, good acting, and another great performance by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Different style and genre but one of my favorite time travel movies since Back to the Future."

0.0,looper,"horrible movie, boring and confusing."

1.0,looper,A great story. Thoroughly enjoyed this film. It was an interesting plot and engaging. Would recommend it.
0.0,looper,"Personally, I was not impressed. Good acting + good action, but the TT logic was just blah. For those who contemplate on theoretical time travel, the entire film was non sequitur; at least as far as my logic takes me. Lots of glitz & Glam with very little substance."
1.0,looper,"With Joseph Gordon-Levitt & Bruce Willis Both Giving Intense Performances, Looper Shows How To Darken The Usually Light Time Travel Genre."
1.0,looper,I could watch this movie over and over.
1.0,looper,"Great story, brilliant ending. They could have taken this to a sequel for the money, but ended it meaningfully instead. Loved it!"
1.0,looper,"Great film. This is everything RIGHT about Sci-Fi. Plus it's simple enough for those who aren't familiar with the genre to understand the story. And as a Sci-Fi fan, I appreciate that."
1.0,looper,love dis movie more future set thn da 70's
1.0,looper,"Great film! Matrix, perhaps?"

1.0,looper,"Mind bending time travel story with great action, realistic characters, and whit. If you like sci-fi your in for a good ride."
0.0,looper,"Sorry, but this is toss. Strung-out seen-it-before time paradox obivousness that has been done far better in many a TV sci-fi, far more intelligently. Humanism, heroism, family-ism, horrorism boredom. Drink heavily before you watch and you might enjoy..."
1.0,looper,Amazing movie with one of the best endings ive seen in a long time! Sheer brilliance
0.0,looper,"unresolved plot holes , convoluted make-up , train wreck foul in all sense of the many words of stink. Made to look cool but it felt like watching a alcoholic mother abandoning her child to buy hot pants."
1.0,looper,I would add the movie in my top ten! I love Joseph Gordon-Levitt and above all Bruce Willis. The fact that they are in a movie together and they play EACH OTHER makes it that much better.
1.0,looper,A Fantastic piece of cinema gold.

1.0,looper,Best Film of 2012...Period
1.0,looper,"Very, VERY good! Nice combination of science fiction along with a good story. I would rank up there with The Matrix and Inception as one of the best Sci-fi films in the past two decades."
1.0,looper,Amazing sci-fi that'll be a classic many years from now
1.0,looper,Best film of 2012!!!
1.0,looper,Wasn't sure what to expect. Very interesting movie
1.0,looper,"I haven't given a movie 5 stars in quite awhile but hands down this is well written, well executed and one of the best time travel movies I've seen. A very creative story with an ending that still manages one last trick up it's sleeve."
1.0,looper,great acting and dialogue makes you feel for the characters in the movie.
0.0,looper,"Spoiler alert: If I change the past, wouldn't the future change, which then would change my attempt at changing the past? Unforgivable special effects."
1.0,looper,Crazy concept. Crazy ending. love mind fuck movies!
1.0,looper,Top Movies (12) TO OWN BLU
1.0,looper,Amazing. Best headspinning movie since Inception.
1.0,looper,"Yeah, I gave it five stars. I liked it so what."
1.0,looper,Figured it out early but still good one!
1.0,looper,"This was a surprising well written, well acted story that completely caught me off guard. Well done!"
1.0,looper,A logistical headache. Totally fresh movie.
1.0,looper,"Non traditional, and entirely refreshing. Transcends traditional sci-fi/action flicks with gravity and with style."
1.0,looper,"Another mindblowing movie. Call me a blind idiot, but I didn't see the ending coming, and that just made things sweeter. JGL kind of outshines Bruce Willis in this film, but overall, it definitely is a must-watch."
1.0,looper,"Such a strange movie, got pretty weird. But In a good way, very mind teasing with the time traveling and the ending was sweet!"
1.0,looper,Joseph Gordon Levitt.
1.0,looper,A fun ride from start to finish.
1.0,looper,"Rian Johnson is not your average filmmaker. Director of arguably the greatest television episode, ""Ozymandias"" from highly the acclaimed drama, Breaking Bad. Johnson delivers once again with a great film and top notch acting"
1.0,looper,"Bloody, gritty and stylish in all possible areas, Looper is pure entertainment for the sci-fi, action and thriller audiences alike, one no to be missed."
1.0,looper,Rian Johnson has yet to disappoint. This is his most layered film yet. Great story. Great acting. Great characters. Just plain great!
1.0,looper,"Another ""DON'T MISS"" Science Fiction thriller. Bruce Willis makes good choices most of the time (this is one). Emily Blunt is great as always and though this film contributed heavily to Joseph Gordon-Levitt's portfolio it's not his best performance (adequate)."
1.0,looper,One of the most original science fiction movies to come along in a very long time!!
1.0,looper,"We might find out some 'Time-Paradox', but during seeing, we're absorbed.Joe's last choice lets us think 'what is my life?'"
1.0,looper,"Excelente. El dominio con los movimientos de cámara fue preciso y una exquisita presentación para el espectador. El hecho de cruzar al veterano Willis con el ""joven"" Levit fue una gran jugada. Sin duda, una de las mejores películas de acción de los últimos años."
1.0,looper,Great futuristic movie with classic acting and film making.

1.0,looper,Exceptionally interesting and intriguing with great acting.
0.0,looper,"This film is a total mess. The concept and idea are very interesting. The pacing is very bad and the movie became boring after an hour. I didn't care about the characters, because there was so little character development... A missed potential."
1.0,looper,One of the best if not the best science fiction films of all time. But there's also a lot of emotion to the film which makes it that much better. Spectacular film!
1.0,looper,Rian Johnson has created a sci- fi masterpiece. The best sci-fi/ action movie since inception. Great Film.

1.0,looper,"Clever, detail orientated, thought provoking, thrilling and extremely well acted, specifically by the main role played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Looper ticks every box, a must see."
1.0,looper,"A sci fi dazzler, Looper exudes the conventional trappings of it's genre and provides and intimate, introspective account of the past, present and future."
1.0,groundhog_day,One of my all-time favorites!
1.0,groundhog_day,"I love this movie. period, end of story."
1.0,groundhog_day,A well-written movie where Phil (our hero) carves out his recursive day and follows through on some ideas and things I would've done myself. The way his repeats are presented leave him open for interpretation.

1.0,groundhog_day,"Bill Murray is great in this film that manages to be be both gut busting funny and deeply emotional at different times. Most of the acting is okay, but it's strength lies in the script and direction it takes with being both family friendly and some crude humor thrown in."

1.0,groundhog_day,Super classic. It will question your religion!
1.0,groundhog_day,The only reason that this movie is not one of the best ever made is that the makers of it did not INTEND to do so...the brilliancy of each scene arises only in retrospective .So 5 stars for fate 3 for trying

1.0,groundhog_day,My favorite comedy --- with a real theological message.
1.0,groundhog_day,"This is pitiful. A thousand people freezing their butts off waiting to worship a rat. What a hype. Groundhog Day used to mean something in this town. They used to pull the hog out, and they used to eat it. You're hypocrites, all of you!"

1.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,"A snapshot of the late 20th century's obsession with UFO's, told with true cinematic panache by Steven Spielberg. The Director's Cut (not the Special Edition) is the version to watch if you have the choice. Truly breathtaking."
0.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,One of the worst movies ever! What was Steven Spielberg thinking? He's a great director but this movie is terrible. To be honest I fell asleep at the end. I guess I just don't appreciate this movie like some people. I just don't understand. 1/2 star

1.0,seventh_seal,"The Seventh Seal, a film of grim and haunting thoughts on death, pain, and agony"
1.0,seventh_seal,"The harder you try to wrap your head around it, the less you'll truly appreciate it. It's best to watch ""The Seventh Seal"" for what it is: a cerebral and existential portrait of crusade-era Sweden that stands as a solemn reminder that death comes for us all."

1.0,seventh_seal,"The seventh seal may very well be Bergman's most prolific work of his career, which is saying quite a lot .

1.0,seventh_seal,"Thought provoking and raises several relevant questions. The filming, acting and the symbolism make this a great work of art as well as an enjoyable movie."
1.0,seventh_seal,An undeniable classic. Those who don't like it should just lose a game of chess against Death.
1.0,seventh_seal,"The bar was raised by Bergman when he made the seventh seal, and very few directors have been able to come close."
1.0,seventh_seal,"""The Seventh Seal"" explores a topic used in movies so many times that today it would seem dated. That topic is facing death and not knowing how to react. Everyone has done it. But even if ""Seal"" was released tomorrow, it would still be as fresh, beautiful and perfect as it was in 1957."
1.0,seventh_seal,Max von Sydow is so stupid doesn't he realize he IS God?
1.0,seventh_seal,What could be more difficult than trying to keep your cool as you await death to make is movie in chess that will determine if you live or die.
1.0,seventh_seal,"Outstanding film about life and death and the thin veil that separates them, using Medieval symbolism with great efficiency. It's like a moving Albrect Dürer."
1.0,seventh_seal,One of the *classics*! I love Bergman films!
1.0,seventh_seal,"""We must make an idol of our fear and call it God."" -Antonius Block The knight, Block, wishes to transcend belief to know God, that God actually exists beyond Death. Here lies his journey."
1.0,seventh_seal,"How is it possible that this film doesn't have a 100%? This film is probably Bergman's biggest achievement. I personally like Wild Strawberries better, but this is a movie that you will have to end up watching if you want to be even the slightest bit efficient on movies."
1.0,seventh_seal,"Though it has dated a little (okay a lot), this is still one of the most challenging and thought-provoking films of the 50s (and provocative if you are a believer)."

1.0,seventh_seal,An eerie film with great insights into religion and human life- all set amidst the simple premise of a game of chess against Death himself.
1.0,seventh_seal,"Entered to the list of my favorites movies without blinking; touched and saluted one of my deepest thoughts I had hidden for long time on my black diary, is the no ending fight that everybody have to referee between fantasy and reality, God and Death!"

1.0,seventh_seal,"I'd never seen this. I was genuinely moved by and enjoyed every minute. I guess that surprised me. I thought this would be good for me, but not necessarily enjoyable. I watched Bridesmaids right after this. That means something. But I don't know what."
1.0,seventh_seal,"A knight returning from the Crusades plays chess with Death in a countryside stricken with the plague. Great gloomy masterpiece that bludgeons you on the head with the message ""you're going to die... no one can save you... and it's going to be HORRIBLE."""
1.0,seventh_seal,"What's to say that hasn't already been said about this one? It's a beautiful observation on God, faith, and life, executed stunningly by Bergman. While I prefer The Virgin Spring (of Bergman's work that I've seen, which isn't nearly enough), this is as good as cinema gets."
1.0,seventh_seal,Amazing film. Great movie about how to deal with death. this film is up high on my list of favorite foreign films.
1.0,seventh_seal,"Having finally seen it, I can say I was surprised by the amount of humour as well as the nuance to Bergman's typically spiritual subtext. Other than that, the stunning scenery, chilling score and cinematography, and... oh, you know, it's a masterpiece. Sheesh."
0.0,seventh_seal,"I didn't like it. At all. I usually like films dealing with themes like this. I usually like a little twisted and surreal films, but I didn't like this very much at all."
1.0,seventh_seal,Death always wins. Death is always around the corner. The answers only come from Death. The sanest characters in this film are indifferent of God's existence entirely. A legendary masterpiece.

1.0,seventh_seal,"Visually striking, sombre but also often (darkly) funny tale of life, plague and death ravaging Sweden in medieval times. Iconic chess scene with Knight Von Sydow and Death is not to be missed."

1.0,seventh_seal,An apocalyptic feel permeates the entire film; this film is also one of the most well-balanced films I have ever seen: nearly every scene is shadowed by another scene of an opposite emotion.

1.0,seventh_seal,"Thought-provoking movie full of metaphors about life and death, light and dark, good and evil, and heaven and hell. A complete work of art that allows for individual interpretations of the questions it asks."
1.0,seventh_seal,A ton of Bergman's dialogue is deceptively straightforward. It was fun listening to my inner optimist and fatalist on opposite shoulders come to quite different conclusions about the Knight's search for purpose in an unforgiving universe.
1.0,seventh_seal,"Un cavaliere incontra la morte, ma prima di soddisfarla vuole trovare Dio e il senso della vita, cosÃ¬ prende tempo sfidandola a scacchi.

1.0,seventh_seal,A master work. A must see and newly rereleased to Blu-ray. We are proud to bring this eternal masterpiece back to the big screen at Cinema 16:9!
1.0,seventh_seal,"Spoofed in BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY, this is the film that made Ingmar Bergmann the campus cult director of the 1960s and launched Max von Sydow's long career."
1.0,seventh_seal,"el juego entre la vida ya la muerte es sencillo de entender, si lo juegas."
1.0,seventh_seal,"A knight and death face each other in a game of chess, but is is much more then that. This is basically about the fear we have with death. I love this movie for many reasons, but watching the knight overcome the fear of death. This movie is not for everyone, but is should be!"
1.0,seventh_seal,Who else but the master Swede Bergman could make a movie where one bloke challenges Death to a game of chess so profound?
1.0,seventh_seal,Great! One of the most beatiful film ever made!
1.0,seventh_seal,Incredible film. Wonderful in acting and technical aspects. A must for film people. Breathtaking and manages to deal with real life questions in a powerful way. One of my favorite films.
1.0,seventh_seal,"for mine not as special as Persona, but the composition of the film (brilliant) and Bergman's formal abilities are nothing short of breathtaking."
1.0,seventh_seal,"Love is as contagious as a cold. It eats away at your strength, morale... If everything is imperfect in this world, love is perfect in its imperfection."
1.0,seventh_seal,"Brilliant and beautiful, and still much more humor than people expect from Bergman"
1.0,seventh_seal,The first and best Ingmar Bergman film I've seen. A knight from the crusades challenges Death to a game of chess for his life when approached and told that it is his time to die.
1.0,seventh_seal,"Beautiful, thought provoking, and pretty much perfect. Max Von Sydow plays Chess with Death so he can find his purpose in life before his inevitable death. Funny in places, very direct in its questioning of God's existence and the exploitation of the weak by organised religion."
1.0,seventh_seal,"Bergman's trademark crisis-of-faith seen as a medieval morality play. A stunning and sometimes playful use of genre to work on philosophy, and truly deserving of its status as ""one of the best films ever made""."
1.0,seventh_seal,"This film forces you to wallow in your mortality. Chilling and sober, with a light touch of dark humor, most of the humor a not so gentle reminder of how we often try to cheat death."
1.0,seventh_seal,I'm actually quite a good player!
1.0,seventh_seal,"Simply put, a cinematic masterpiece."
1.0,seventh_seal,"A brilliant meditation on God, death, and the meaning of life."
1.0,seventh_seal,Dies irae dies illa...
1.0,seventh_seal,"Really good film, I liked the dialogue and story, but the cinematography really completed the work. I would like to watch it a couple more times before I have to return it."
1.0,seventh_seal,"This was absolutely amazing! I actually watched it for two days in a row, and am now considering a thrid day.....hmmmmm. But I don't to that, I just can't stop watching it!"
1.0,seventh_seal,"In this classic film a Swedish knight freshly returned from the Crusades plays a game of chess with death. Death enters the contest knowing that his victory is inevitable, but the knight ""wins"" in the end because he wasn't playing for his own life. Powerful story about the value of self-sacrifice."
1.0,seventh_seal,You can't really understand this movie until you enter the second half of your life.
1.0,seventh_seal,Alguien quiere jugar ajedez con la muerte mas genial en la historia del cine. Tengan paciencia es una gran historia
1.0,seventh_seal,Paramount and beautiful.
1.0,seventh_seal,"Ingmar Bergman's classic about a knight's game of chess with death after returning from the Crusades is a film that is great and also fun. Brilliantly balanced and crafted, THE SEVENTH SEAL is cinematic history."
1.0,seventh_seal,"really, one of the legit greatest movies of all time. brilliant. now; lets all dance with death"
1.0,seventh_seal,I'm in love with Bibi Andersson.

1.0,seventh_seal,wonderfullllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
1.0,seventh_seal,well deserves it's reputation as a cinematic masterpiece. But while it is a dark film it is also alot more humourous than you would think.
1.0,seventh_seal,As perfect a film as I've ever seen.
1.0,seventh_seal,"People always invoke the dark, dour, and austere qualities of this movie. But I think a lot of them overlook how incredibly funny it is as well. A great meditation on life and death."
1.0,seventh_seal,Death is a very strange character here.
1.0,seventh_seal,"Creative, touching, beautiful. Rich imagery and deep subject matter leave a lasting imprint on the soul."
1.0,seventh_seal,"Well-crafted and meticulous, in cinematography, plot, dialogue and acting. Thought-provoking, direct and unafraid to explore deep questions about existence. Enjoyable, though not necessarily for the usual reasons."
1.0,seventh_seal,"Even though it is not the most entertaining movie in the world, it is a piece of cinema that you can really sink your teeth into and is very thought provoking. Excellent acting with an excellent storyline and just a twist of humor thrown in for good measure."
1.0,seventh_seal,"This resonates over and over and over. It's brilliance is not so much the chess games with Death, rather the juxtapositioning of these quiet-calm interior scenes against the exterior horror and misery of plague and poverty.."
1.0,seventh_seal,"A sublime meditation on life and death that'll surely take more than one viewing to fully appreciate. Surprisingly funny, too!"
1.0,seventh_seal,"Classic Ingmar Bergman, for those who like a movie that makes one think"
1.0,seventh_seal,"It's actually been a while since I've seen this, but having a family member struggle with a catastrophic illness brought it to mind, and the metaphors suddenly have more impact than ever. Ditto for Wild Strawberries, Winter Light... just about the entire Bergman ouevre."
1.0,seventh_seal,it will make you think and feel.it will make you shiver.
1.0,seventh_seal,"jeden z nejlepÅ¡Ã­ch, snad i nejlepÅ¡Ã­ a mÅ¯j zamilovanÃ½"
1.0,seventh_seal,"Even though there's the Death in the movie, with all do respect, it's a comedy for Death sake. A comedy about life and death... hmm... surely reminds me of some guy named Woody."
1.0,seventh_seal,On my top ten. This haunting movie should be watched and studied.
1.0,seventh_seal,"Very humane, beautiful."
1.0,seventh_seal,"Wow! Bergman is just INCREDIBLE. I am sure most of my friends wouldn't sit through his films, but this is just beyond amazing."
1.0,seventh_seal,"one of my favourite foreign films, ever. beautifully shot and written, with a mesmerising cast. fantastic!"
1.0,seventh_seal,A total masterpiece...brilliant!
1.0,seventh_seal,"It's Max Von Sydow. It's Ingmar Bergman. It's the inspiration for ""Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey."" Need I go on?"

1.0,1013775-metropolis,Even though it is not my number 1 sci-fi film (only because it is hard for me to watch silent films) I can agree that Metropolis is the greatest sci-fi film of all time.

0.0,1013775-metropolis,i felt like the most interesting thing in the movie was the music. All throughout the movie there is different types of music like fast or mysterious to show something bad is happening or about to happen. The music definetely made the movie a lot more intense.

1.0,jodorowskys_dune,It is a great documentary and I wish they had made the movie. Jodorowsky did gather a fantastic team.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"After Reading Herbert's Dune I had to watch Jodorowsky's Dune and wow.. Most crazy thing to learn was that I 'saw' most of the artwork it inspired already, through the reading of the Metabarons & the Incal. What a great & inspiring man. i hope one day they'll make this movie, in some form."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Ain't it amusing that the documentary on Jodorowsky's potential DUNE was far better than the actual DUNE we got from a ball-clamped Lynch?
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,See great creative leader in action & where many iconic Sci-Fi came from.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Dune could have been awesome with this documentary showing on how this would have been a pioneer to all Science Fiction films! Truly incredible
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,This is a such a well-crafted and inspiring doc that I found profoundly heartbreaking and awe-inspiring. Watch it with your cinephile friends or even a date- you're gonna end up at an all-night diner drinking coffee and talking about it.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Fantastic, so disappointed this movie was never made."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,TRULY brilliant and inspiring.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Incredible and amazing! Anyone interested and loves films should watch this. A must-see. Dune must be made Jodorowsky's way.
0.0,jodorowskys_dune,I WATCH EVERYTHING! Kind of a historical conversation but very fabricated. The guy was claiming genius. It took an army to create Dune!
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,One of the best docs. I've seen in a while. The saddest part about this movie is that it made me think of Jodorowsky's age and that someday he'll die and I'll have to live the rest of my life without another one of his films.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,This may be one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. The stories of assembling of his team right down to the designs are so engaging and interesting. His Dune was really something special that never happened and actually this movie makes you admire him more as a film maker after watching it.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Oh what might have been! MÃ¶bius, Giger, Salvador DalÃ­, and Chris Foss. It would have been transformational. Instead we got that piece of excrement from David Fucking Lynch, the worst director in Hollywood history."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"I really felt for him, the joy and pain of creating. I love the Dune that is, and am intrigued by the Dune that could have been. I wonder what it would have inspired in me at 11, had I seen it instead."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Amazing! a great story about a passionate filmmaker.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Maybe we've not been prepared to see that picture yet. The story goes on.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Amazing documentary about the never completed movie project of one of the masters of surrealism and metaphysics-fiction. Jodoroswky far from being a master and a legend is an advanced soul never accepted or understood in the prostituted mainstream scene.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,An amazing glimpse into the unproduced vision of Alejandro Jodorowsky.
0.0,jodorowskys_dune,We just rented this documentary based on the high rating. It was extremely disapointing. We love documentaries however definately not this one. Boring interviews with boring people talking about how profound this movie making project is to them. Nothing happens so dont waste your time!
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Wish someone would make jodoroskys version of Dune.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,me and my dad love it
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Fun look at the would-have-been making of Dune. Though, I would much much much rather have seen the actual movie!"
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Some day this Masterpiece will be reality.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"how come he didn't hire a spiritial warrior accountant to keep the cost down? still, pretty damn inspiring"
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Najlepsie scifi ktore nikdy nebolo natocene
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,It was interesting to see how Jodorowsky envisioned a film version of Dune. I had read about how there was a fun being planned in Brian Herbert's biography of his father and this film shows the process and how close Jodorowsky was to completing the film and how it would have looked.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Must watch for sci-fi fans.Would have been an amazing film!
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Film as it is is definitely not a masterpiece, but to see this crazy person and his visions come alive is probably most inspiring piece of film I have seen"
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"I burst out in tears when I saw this, absolutely amazing documentary."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Wow. Would have been the best science fiction film ever! Learned so much about how ahead of his time Jodorowsky was and how everyone copied his work afterwards. Excellent documentary.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,brother in arms. forever dope.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,This will never be a movie and that depresses me.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,I want to live in a universe where Dune exists.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Utterly thoughtful, whimsical, intimidating and above all else, fantastic."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Fellow Sci-Fi geeks, this is trippy and worth the watch."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,My favourite ever documentary. An absolutely spellbinding look into the creative genius and passion behind Jodorowsky's Dune. A truly remarkable and inspiring film.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Don't think it can be made as it would have been back then with that crazy bunch but i'd still wanna watch it if it does
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,La película perfecta es la que jamás logró hacerse.Los que chuparon de su creatividad para alimentar su propia creatividad.Tremendo artista Jodo.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"It doesn't only serve as a brilliant documentary about the greatest film never made, but also as a message to every ambitious filmmaker in the world and as a burst and reaction towards the extremely conservative nature of Hollywood. The world missed one of the greatest films ever."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Fantastic, please let him create a kickstarter, I wish so much that he would finally make it. He can have all of my money, just make it."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Proof that there is no limit to the imagination!
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"The story of an audacious, maddening, brilliant film that was never made. Jodorowsky will infect your mind with possibilities and you will never forget him."
0.0,jodorowskys_dune,Seriously? A documentary movie about a guy who thought about makin a revolutionary rehash of Dune. Who never made the freaking movie???? WTF really there's no movie?? I thought I was going to watch an awesome version of Dune.....Uhm horrible.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Jodorowsky's Dune is a fascinating examination of a maverick director's attempt to make his passion project - an adaptation of the classic sci-fi book Dune. Showing the creative process and the business side of moviemaking, it emphasizes the back and forth of crafting such an ambitious project."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Inspirational, funny, entertaining, and just an overall perfectly crafted documentary. I seriously wish Dune was made ugh."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Incredible. Jadorowsky is an amazing person and his genius and heart shines through. Tragic that this film never got made.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"wonderful, funny, transformative!"
0.0,jodorowskys_dune,Lame... unless you're on drugs at the time.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Fantastic documentary of a grand vision that Hollywood wouldn't make. It gives you a lot to think about. The novel in my opinion was the best sci-fi book ever written. Jodorowsky's take would have been a sight to see.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Thanks for give us an excellent journey.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,I hope some day someone can do that film. Like Jodorowsky.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Divertida y por completo enferma, las situaciones planteadas y las anécdotas contadas hacen por si solas un documental memorable."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Brilliant! Hollywood needs more artist and less accountants. Oh what might have been. I would love to see his vision in a CGI animated movie.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Jaw dropping, heart breaking, and incredibly inspiring."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"the best docu about the film you will never see,,, in this dimension at least!"
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,The failure of the Dune's project lead by Jodorowsky is just as big as his ambition with this project. Still today this movie remains a ground breaking movement in the Science Fiction movie genere. Even if it never came to be.This is by far the most inspiring documentary I have ever seen in my life.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"I hate what Hwood does to art and dreams.This must be made, one way or another."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,The story of the greatest film never made by an unsung genius. I will gush about this film and of Jodorowsky endlessly. We owe 30 years celebrated films to this man's passion and unrealized dreams.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,a tragedy this movie has never been made. the amount of dedication and ambition put into it and not then finalized is a loss for everyone.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"PLEASE COME TO VOD, VIDEO AND GET NOMINATED FOR AN OSCAR, YOU MAGNIFICENT FASCINATING CREATURE!"
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,What a brilliant man. I have mad respect for this guy!
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Few films dazzle and enthral with their ideas quite like this one. Jodorowsky's Dune offers an intriguing insight into a unique vision of the greatest sci-fi never filmed, made all the more captivating by the passion of Jodorowsky himself."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Gotta give this a full 5 stars, because this man's enthusiasm on every level... artistic, spiritual, life, etc. is so infectious... that alone is worth the price of admission."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Wow! What a visionary!!!
0.0,jodorowskys_dune,Weird does not begin to describe this. I have never been more thankful that David Lynch directed Dune rather than the tragic disaster this would have been.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Based on my Giger and O'Bannon's Alien obsessions, I had been somewhat aware of this failed film . What I was not aware of was how spectacular and insane, and unique it had been. One of the best studies of the human imagination you'll ever see."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Would love to see his version of Dune on the big screen!
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Insight into a mind of movie that was never made but did so much.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"A great documentary that makes you love filmmaking again, and makes you wish you could see his version of dune."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Jodorowsky. What a guy! Fab documenrary about a movie that was (sadly) never made. Interesting and inspirational. You'll think about it long after you leave the theatre.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Fantastic to think what this group of artist luminaries could have produced with Frank Herbert's masterpiece. One thing that bothered me though, seems like half the people involved in the almost-making of this movie never read the book!"
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Fascinating and inspiring.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Wonderful documentary that gives the needed respect for an extravert artist
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,The best movie I've seen all year.

0.0,1010792-its_a_wonderful_life,Well it is definitely not a wonderful movie.
1.0,1010792-its_a_wonderful_life,"Maybe the best holiday film of all-time. There's some real magic at work here from Frank Capra, which is timeless. I almost tear up at the finish every time. I would say, however, that George Bailey probably owes his child's teacher an apology."
1.0,1010792-its_a_wonderful_life,"It's interesting to know that this timeless holiday classic actually wasn't a hit when it first came out on Christmas 1946, but was eventually embraced by millions. Cary Grant was considered for the role, but he was busy filming another excellent film, The Bishop's Wife, playing the angel Dudley."
1.0,1010792-its_a_wonderful_life,It's more wonderful every year I watch it. What makes me marvel at this film so much is how hard it would be to nail all these notes with a modern film.

1.0,district_9,This movie was truly amazing
0.0,district_9,"Bluntest, most ham-fisted approach to social commentary. Incapable of any subtlety, District 9 is happy to dishonestly present pseudo socio-political themes, and shove them down the toilet to focus on grotesque caricature and bland, juvenile, simplistic science fiction."
1.0,district_9,Fuck you Ryan! Fake science is the reason I don't like it since I have a degree in science.
1.0,district_9,One of the most original and exciting sci go movies in a long time

1.0,district_9,"The excessively irritating personality of the main human character was not necessary, but that can be forgiven because Blomkamp has taken a brilliant premise and added visual spectacle and insane action to create something extraordinary."

1.0,district_9,Wow! Can't believe I took so long to watch it. Freaking amazing movie.
0.0,district_9,"First 10 minutes promised an imaginative provocative story with clever reportage techniques and interesting photography. Sadly, it all goes downhill thereafter."
0.0,district_9,Graphics were awesome. That is it. The movie was so full of F bombs it became completely unwatchable. I watched a commentary on it and it seems the more the movie went along the less the main actor stuck to the script.
1.0,district_9,Not enough humans could be blasted to bits.
1.0,district_9,Such a great movie! The story kind of starts as a news story and I think the writer was trying to show early on that the public's perspective based on the media can be far from what's actually going on. Highly Recommend !!!

1.0,district_9,"It was refreshing to see a SciFi movie that turns the genre on it's ear. The movie is fantastic in it's realism, with even the most over the top special effects believable.

1.0,pinocchio_1940,One of the great films from the era of Walt Disney himself!

1.0,pinocchio_1940,"Richly drawn with memorable characters and beautiful songs, Pinocchio is an early Disney classic, embodying everything you'd expect from a Disney cartoon.

1.0,the_hunger_games_catching_fire,Very loyal adaptation of the book. It really sets the backdrop well for the final book. It appropriately moves the focus of the story from the games itself to the big picture and major theme behind the whole series. So much looking forward to the final installment of the series in 2 movies.

1.0,the_hunger_games_catching_fire,"There's nothing not to love about these movies, it's just popcorn flick heaven. The thrilling climax was made more thrilling by the will-I-won't-I urinate my shorts action (drank too much water at dinner)."

1.0,the_hunger_games_catching_fire,"A-MAZ-ING!!!!! So close to the book, but not as good i don't personally like the direction the movies go compared to the book. But to be fair the book was mostly what Katniss was thinking which made it better"

But nevertheless, the film impresses with great actors, fascinating scenes and a really dark atmosphere. A Top-Film!"
1.0,the_hunger_games_catching_fire,"I hesitate here, but this film is nearly perfect. Major props to Francis Lawrence for following the book word for word rather then trying to spin it off in a different direction. The book was made for an incredible movie, no point in changing it at all."
1.0,the_hunger_games_catching_fire,This movie was way better than the hunger games I felt like there was more depth to the characters and it wasn't just some movie set and Francis Lawrence stuck to the book more than the first hunger games movie.

0.0,gravity_2013,The worst script ever.
1.0,gravity_2013,"Grade - AWith some of the best CGI I've ever seen and good performances from Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, the only thing stopping 'Gravity' from becoming a perfect film is its script."
1.0,gravity_2013,Gravity is one of the greatest space movies I've ever seen. Its so realistic it seems to have really been filmed in space.
0.0,gravity_2013,"This movie was foolish and illogical. The only gravitational pull was the inexplicable draw of disasters to Sandra Bullock, despite the laws of physics and aerospace dynamics. I would give it a zero, but that won't register on this voting system."

1.0,spiderman_2,My favorite and best of the series
1.0,spiderman_2,"5/5 *Focusing more on the troubled character, rather than the superpowers, Spiderman 2 is a thoughtful film, with humor an intimidating villain and great action scenes making for one of the greatest superhero films."
1.0,spiderman_2,"Rarely does a sequel come along that it better than the already-great first movie, with more action and a better story. But screw movie logic, Spider-Man 2 does it anyway."
1.0,spiderman_2,Still one of the best
1.0,spiderman_2,An outstanding instalment to the franchise. Fantastic storyline with good character development and a really good feeling from the film. 10/10
1.0,spiderman_2,"The only issue with this film is the standard it set for superhero films from then on. The best performances, the coolest-orchestrated fight scenes and the leaning away from a pompous, Russian-esque asshole to a badass corrupted ex-man Doc Ock."
1.0,spiderman_2,A fantastic sequel that delves deeper into the characters while also providing some of the most exciting superhero action ever put on film
1.0,spiderman_2,Best Spider-Man movie ever

1.0,spiderman_2,"It's been ten years since its release, and yet I am still in love with Spider-Man 2. This is easily one of the best comic book movies. I can't really explain the greatness of this movie. It's really a miracle that needs to be witnessed."
1.0,spiderman_2,A sequel that improves on the already great predecessor.
0.0,spiderman_2,Hated it first time I saw it just a big over the top love story! Disliked Toby Maguire as Peter Parker and wasted one of the best comic book villains by under using them!
1.0,spiderman_2,BEST SPIDERMAN MOVIE. PERIOD
1.0,spiderman_2,"''Spider-Man 2'' is and, in my opinion, will remain one of the best superhero movies of all time. With Alfred Molina who steals the show as the main villain, great action sequences and fight scenes and also great character development, this movie is one of the best movies of 2004."
1.0,spiderman_2,An absolutely dazzling film. Childhood favorite.
1.0,spiderman_2,Even better than the original mostly due to Alfred Molina's portrayal as Dr Octavius.

0.0,spiderman_2,Possibly one of the worst comic book interpretations ever. Even worse than Green Lantern.
1.0,spiderman_2,"A great sequel for the Spider-Man franchise. It has drama, action, and a awesome villain, Dr. Octopus."
1.0,spiderman_2,Out if the Sam Raimi trilogy I love this one Actually only like this one.
1.0,spiderman_2,"probably the last great spiderman film we'll see for a while, the new amazing spiderman is garbage"
1.0,spiderman_2,"a little batter than the first, but not much. Doctor octopus is awesome. Tobey Maguire plays a perfect spider-man, and James Franco a good harry."
1.0,spiderman_2,One of the greatest comic book-film adaptations ever put to film. Everything a sequel should be.
1.0,spiderman_2,The deepest and most resonating film in the series. It gives us an amazing villain and some truly stellar action sequences.
1.0,spiderman_2,"Another good movie, the second time around was a great sequel. They definately needed to give some sort of award for it's digital effects. The cast was not quite as strong as the first one, but it was still good."
1.0,spiderman_2,Best of the three. Dr octapus is the reason.
0.0,spiderman_2,Better than spider-man 1 & 3
1.0,spiderman_2,Spider-Man 2 ranks alongside The Dark Knight as one of the best superhero films.
1.0,spiderman_2,A classic among superhero films. The strongest of the franchise. And Doctor Octopus is surprisingly the greatest Spider-Man villain to grace the screen. Note: The extended dvd version (Spider-Man 2.1) is better than the theatrical version.
0.0,spiderman_2,Zero stars total rubbish
1.0,spiderman_2,Another of the great sequels that improves upon the original.
1.0,spiderman_2,I was on the edge of my seat the whole movie

1.0,spiderman_2,The movie that got me into comic book heroes!
1.0,spiderman_2,"With impressive special effects and an outstanding performance from Alfred Molina, Spider-Man 2 builds upon what made the first installment a success, progressing the story and getting into the sacrifices a hero must make to do the right thing."
1.0,spiderman_2,This is probably the best Spider-man movie so far!
1.0,spiderman_2,Classic superhero action
1.0,spiderman_2,A awesome film to watch. Properly the best Spider-Man film that Sam Raimi has done in the series.
1.0,spiderman_2,"The best Spider-Man film ever (or at least so far). Spider-Man 2 brings excitement, action, romance and a strong villain and plot to support it, there isn't much bad about this film, and if there is, please tell me."
1.0,spiderman_2,Review coming soon....
1.0,spiderman_2,The movie that all other comic book movies have been trying to top and so few have even come close.
1.0,spiderman_2,"With a greater sense of heart and overall character development, Spider Man 2 is what a sequel should be like. Improving on the plot, greatly improving on the dialogue, and impressive fight sequences, Spider Man 2 is the greatest movie in the Marvel universe that will ever exist.A+"
1.0,spiderman_2,Raimi focuses more on action rather than origin in this solid sequel.
1.0,spiderman_2,"One of the best sequels ever made. Spider Man 2 is even better the awesome first movie. The romance is genuine, the villain is a real threat and the action is great. Spider Man 2 focuses a little more on Peter's powers failing and him trying to improve. It's a great follow up to a great movie."
1.0,spiderman_2,"The sequel focuses more on Peter Parker than it does on Spider-Man. As such, there is a surprisingly good blend of pathos and great action sequences. A good deal of praise definitely goes to Alfred Molina, the puppeteers and CGI experts who make Doc Ock one cool tragic villain."
1.0,spiderman_2,"One of the best films I have ever seen. It lived up to the hype it was producing and proved to be the best summer film. No action film, especially not a spiderman one, will ever be better than this one. It stays consistent, builds momentum, and has its dramatic and tensing moments."
1.0,spiderman_2,"The best of the serie, Spider-Man 2 is one of my favorite super-heros movie of all time, with a developped villain and a mesmerizing performance by Mr. Maguire."

1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Cocteau's take on ""Beauty and the Beast"" is a gorgeously stylized and thematically complex adult fairy tale."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"A wondrous and beautiful film. I wouldn't call myself captivated by it, as I am with other films, but calling it anything less than film magic is simply unfair. Truly a work of art."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,It's a surrealistic version of beauty and the beast that creates even more of an impression because of the lack of technological advances.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"I almost find this version of the classic story to be more impressive than the animated one, not only because the special effects were on par (if not better) than any of the ""Universal Monsters"", but that the addition of the ""evil sisters"" made Belle seem like that much more of a hero."

Lead performances are wonderful"
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"With its enchanting visual effects and bewitching performances, Beauty and the Beast is to this day the most dreamlike and mournful of the fairytale's film adaptations."

1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"In his own words, Jean Cocteau was a poet. This film doesn't make sense, but I guess it's not supposed to: it is surrealist art. It has to be seen if for no other reason than its iconic art direction and costumes (designed by the couture house Lanvin)."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Une vraie merveille ! 1h30 de poÃ©sie. MalgrÃ© les annÃ©es, ce film reste la plus belle version du conte... Merci Cocteau."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,One of the great masterpieces of fantasy film. The actors bring life and poetry to Cocteau's splendidly realized unreal world by investing it with belief and commitment within the context of the period's prevailing acting style.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"a masterpiece throughout. one of the greatest films of all time, it should be appreciated more but as its old and french the chances are pretty slim unless you get naomi Watts to be in a remake of it (ARGH!) in my top 10 of all time. really love it."

1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Haunting, to say the least. Cocteau does a fantastic job with this film, and only a person from France could produce such a transfer from the old fairy tale."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Jean Cocteau's version is simply the best! Truly gorgeous.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Beautiful tale, amazing set and beautiful photography - real poetry"
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Legendary tale, legendary film, far beyond its time. The most beautiful black-and-white pictures you can get. And the most beautiful beast: Greta Garbo commented when seeing this film and Jean Marais without the mask: ""Give me back my beautiful beast."" And quite rightly!"
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,this has got to be the most beautiful movie ever made.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"A sublime realisation of the mature intent of all great fairytales, Cocteau's 'Beauty & The Beast' is beautiful in a way few films are, a storybook dream that is fantastical, yet also resonant with the deepest longings of the heart. And without a singing teapot in sight!"

1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,This is seriously one of my favorite movies and possibly my favorite version of the story (hard to decide because I truly love the Disney version). I borrow this film from the library often and just gush over it. I just love it.

1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Les vieilles romances
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Stunning and beautiful beyond words. Amazing special effects that only further the story.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"One of Cocteau's - and cinema's - finest moments. Stunning, sumptuous sets and with a tragic tenderness at its heart."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"I remember we watched it at the cine-club when 6. It stayed in my mind as it was an enchanting fable. When I watched it again, many year's later, I understood why. Cocteau's visual style was so forward at the time. It is just an amazing film!"
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Fantastic French fairtale
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"if this is the version of Cocteau, then i give 5 stars"
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,The best looking movie ever? Any fan of Gustave Dor'e must see this.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Completely unique telling of the tale that is atmospheric, mesmorizing, and absorbing. Some outstanding make up and a hell of a production design."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Tremendous...mesmerising, yet unsettling, one of the great adaptations of folklore. Sophisticated, and almost modern for its time, leaves most fairytales-on-film looking 2-dimensional, distinctly last-century by comparison."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"special effects are supposed to enhance a story, not drive it, and for this reason, the basic special effects here from the 1940s obliterate most special effect movies that exist today."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,A great Cocteau film with some inspired photography and special effects. Magical.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Agonizingly beautiful and ethereal. Emotes strongly. Watch this and disregard the Disney trite.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"The, unfortunately, less seen adaptation of Beauty and the Beast. This French film is more imaginary than the original, the characters are better developed, and the Disney one didn't twist my emotions like this one did."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"i loved the movie! it's a beautiful film and if you were a fan of the disney remake, you have to see this version. this movie is slightly creepy and even funny at times!"
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Quite simply one of the best film adaptations of a fairytale ever made; full of beautiful, dream-like surreal imagery. Brilliantly well-realised and utterly enchanting throughout."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"""This is the movie that got me into French surrealism. I just think it's really pretty, and it's the sort of movie you never, ever see anymore these days."""
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Based on the old story of Beauty and the Beast. This is beautiful film with stunning imagery.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,this is such a beautiful film. it enhances a gorgeous story and without all the special effects that films seem to rely on today appears magical.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,The cinema's greatest fairy tale. A visual wonder.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,A beautiful film that becomes even more amazing when you realize that it was filmed at the end of the Second World War. The juxtaposition of fantasy and the reality of the war around it is truly amazing
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Wow, if you haven't seen it, see it. Disney owes much to this timeless classic. Jean Cocteau shows us seemless visuals of a beauty and standard that are few and far between these days. Simple, elegant, imaginative story telling for a absoulte master."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,This movie turned me into a Jean Cocteau and Henri Alekan fan. Visual magic and the story to go with it. It's hard to believe it was made over 60 years ago.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Enchanting like nobody's business.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Insane...watch it if only for the candle holding arms in the wall
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"i didn't like this too much at first, but it grew on me. now i must own it."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,I love this 1946 version of Beauty and the Beast more than the Disney version. The special effects done for that time period were amazing. One of my all time favorite movies.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Amazing. The simple techniques of reverse and slow motion make the film enchanting.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"I honestly love this film! The lanterns are something else! I wish I had an amazing castle like that! Turn off the subtitles though, that's the BEST way to watch! it's french duh! :D"
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Cocteau at his peak.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Haunting, mysterious, and dreamy. It has aged, but somehow maintains a strange power about it."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Wow...this is such a fantastic, beautiful telling of one of my favorite fairy tales. It's in French, but there are subtitles of course. And the special effects might be old-fashioned, but that makes it all the more magical instead of holding it back."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Cocteau maintains the psychology and mysterious fairy tale beauty of the original story, and throws his own ideas, inventions, and images into the mix. Pretty much the best movie ever."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"It's terrif. The acting is superb, and the special effects put today to shame. Especially when you consider they were getting all their stuff stolen, since it was right after the war."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,A great work of imagination.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"She cries diamonds, and this was made in the 1940s. No CGI, just pure movie magic."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Sheer magic. Cocteau shows why he is considered one of the great artists of the 20th century. His imagination and technical prowess in this film are unparalleled. 10/10
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,so beautiful! i watched the whole film on the french channel with no subtitles
0.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Wow. I went into this fully expecting to love it, since Beauty and the Beast is one of my favorite fairytales, but I find that I can't understand what all the hype is about. Maybe I expected too much?"
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,The best cinematic adaptation of this story and one that inspires again and again. Definitely a fantastic flick for preparing to watch Pan's Labyrinth or Legend.

0.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Seen it but didn't really like it..
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,I saw this before and after I read the story in French and it still continues to amaze me. Cocteau is a poet and Marais perfectly captures his words.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Mesmerising. Its dreamlike atmosphere and beautiful mise en scene virtually lulled me into a trance. Unlike Cocteau's earlier surrealist ""Blood of a Poet"" (1930), this movie is surreal in aid of creating a fairytale atmosphere, to enhance a story."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"The most beautiful love story ever told indeed! It mesmerizes with every sparkle, tear, every glance from the beast!"
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"A really wonderful film. A lot better than I thought it would be. The story is beautiful, timeless, and classic. It's a masterpiece!"

1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Find it, watch it, you'll be pleased."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"A wonderful adaptation of the story, all the strange bits of folklore are there, as well as the natural terror and disgust one would feel when first confronted by something which was neither human nor animal (something noticeably lacking in the America cartoon)."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"It's a visually beautiful film. Anyone who needs pointers on art direction should check this film out (as well as ""Kaidan"")."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"A masterpiece, very different from the Disney cartoon version. I like them both, but the Cocteau version is much, much better. The atmosphere is very magical and haunting, and Cocteau's effects are plain awesome. I prefer Orpheus, but this movie is also one of my favorites."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,One of the most beautiful movies ever made. This is no happy Disney film with singing and dancing; this is a dark fantasy that is engaging throughout and stunning in its design.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,This is the film Disney turned into a musical. I love it as much as I love disney's version.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Wow. La magia del cine está encarnada en el collar.

1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Startling, aching beauty and incredible invention keep this a fairy tale on the edge."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Better than the Disney film, Cocteau knew how to make a great Fantasy film. Rather than rely on High Fantasy elements like the hero's quest, his use of surrealist and bizarre visual art preceded films by directors like Guillermo del Toro."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,must see brilliant cocteau film
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"One of the most beautiful things I have ever seen. The whole film feels like some beautiful dream, filled with perfume, music and magic."

0.0,the-evil-dead,"I honestly do not understand how this movie has a 95%. It is a completely asinine and worthless mess of a gore-fest with extremely kitschy and genuinely stupid parts to it.

1.0,the-evil-dead,mostly I deplore remakes/reboots but this I loved and frankly love it better than the original. I saw Army of darkness first and saw evil dead after and did not like evil dead but when I saw this in the theater with friends I have to say I like what I saw.spectacular update.

1.0,the-evil-dead,best raimi film ever.
1.0,the-evil-dead,"While I never saw the supposed humour in this, The Evil Dead it the epitomal evidence that a low budget, natural special effects and original premises prove to be the most terrifying, superior and kick-ass horror films."
1.0,the-evil-dead,"Undeniably, one the most unique horror films ever made. Sure, it's cheesy and not scary. But that doesn't mean it wasn't artistically made. Sam Raimi's delivers a new way of filming, while Bruce Campbell is being his slapstick best."
1.0,the-evil-dead,"I didn't think I would like this as much as I did. The build up that I got from my sister made me think it would be worse than it was. I loved it. For it's time I believe that it was quite the horror, nowadays it is still creepy but not as terrifying as I was told it was."

1.0,the-evil-dead,One f the scariest movies ever
1.0,the-evil-dead,"The evil dead is a crazed, low budget spook that may be funny in its ""dark humor"" range but its originality, added with its low budget effects, and old timey, sounds, makes evil dead impressively a serious one-of-a-kind scare"
1.0,the-evil-dead,"Sam Raimi's first full-length film is a relentless, gore-filled, cheesy horror film that set the standard for relentless, gore-filled, cheesy horror films. The laughs and scares are constant and, despite the hammy acting, the movie is just tons of fun."

1.0,the-evil-dead,"Sometimes I wanted to be scared but couldn't resist to laugh at the movie's cheesy acting and bad makeup. How they portrayed Ash in the beginning made me literally laugh it loud.

1.0,the-evil-dead,"legendary and iconic, the fact it was Sam Rami's first movie is nothing short of extraordinary. The effects and ""CGI"" are laughable by today's standards but takes nothing away from how really disturbing this movie really is and still stands the test of time"

1.0,8-12,Fellini' surreal and unconventional masterpiece that gets into the heart and mind of a filmmaker.
1.0,8-12,"8 1/2 shows the greatness of Fellini's cinematic technique in a creative, smart and beautiful production."
1.0,8-12,"It's a seminal work of interwoven dreams that is so seamlessly put together the audience often has trouble deciding what is relatity, and what is not. For most movies, this would prove disastrous. But for 8 1/2, it's a factor that is critical in the film's success."
1.0,8-12,"8 1/2 is a soaring achievement of filmmaking, possibly the greatest of Federico Fellini's career, and simply one of the most creative, challenging, and comical movies ever made."
1.0,8-12,"La vida es una fiesta, vivámosla con Fellini... ¡Qué pinche CHULADA de pelicula!"
1.0,8-12,"This is simply genius film making - thematically and artistically. Just when I want to critique it on something, it addresses my critique with sharp self-awareness. It's spectacular to behold with memorable scenes and superb shot making. A Big (capital ""B"") film in all senses of the word."
1.0,8-12,"8 1/2 is one of the best movies about film making, within a fantasy that clashes with reality.Short answer = It's a masterpiece"
1.0,8-12,The best italian movie. The best Fellini's dream.
1.0,8-12,"The thing I loved about this film when I first watched it was that almost everything in 8 1/2 contradicts the traditional seamless story line of the conventional Hollywood film. For film makers, this is the film to watch."
0.0,8-12,The most pretentious waste of celluloid I've ever wasted my time on.
1.0,8-12,"A perfect film, that touches the reality in such a personal, but oniric way, giving you the strength to live naturally, not for the others, but to live for you, with the others."

1.0,8-12,"Asa nisi masa, so save time. Three different languages?"
1.0,8-12,"we are smothered by words, images and sounds that have no right to exist, that come from the void and return to the void. Of any artist truly deserving of the name we should ask nothing but this act of faith: to learn silence."
1.0,8-12,One of most beautifully shot movies ever! Fellini at his best. Insightful but slow at times
1.0,8-12,"Wonderful performances, gorgeous cinematography, beautiful musical score, immaculately directed and an intriguing non-linear storyline. My favourite film of all time. What more can I say."

1.0,8-12,"Fellini on Fellini, on Film, on Life, on everything."
1.0,8-12,"A splendid film by Federico Fellini, a story about a film director, drained out of ideas and without the motivation to deal with his new film. Reality and fantasy mixed during the story exploring the main character's subconscious."

1.0,8-12,back to brilliant classics....
1.0,8-12,Can't believe it took me so long to see something by Fellini. What a trip this movie is.

1.0,8-12,This movie made me cry cos I thought it was so beautiful.
1.0,8-12,"It's an ineffable film. I'll just simply state that I watched it twice in a month, and once it took me 3 1/2 hours to watch it because I had so many merging thoughts and ideas coming together in my brain. It's a good sign."

1.0,8-12,One of the all-time greats. Grows richer with repeated viewing.

1.0,8-12,"Lusciously elaborate.... and a genuine masterpiece, I don't think I've ever seen a director perfect a picture of such creativity, it is an artwork in itself. Fellini blends imagination with reality so astonishingly, you wonder; how on earth?"

1.0,8-12,An strike of the ages.
1.0,8-12,"Cinema's most insane and crazy director while still being one of the most literate makes his true masterpiece with 8 1/2. This films is beautiful, horrifying, hilarious, insane, saddening, and memorizing, usually all at the same time. A filmmakers kind of film."

1.0,8-12,again who is the idiot who hates this film??
1.0,8-12,I'm blinded by the lights. And then the movie. Guido's Occhiali are in a league by themselves.
1.0,8-12,This movie made feel like that I was trapped in a filmmaker's nightmare that was completely out of control.
1.0,8-12,while 'the matrix' and 'inception' made the 'dream' movie popular..this absolute masterpiece of a movie is one few have heard of and fewer have seen..a difficult film executed with the most utmost precision and delivers a film of experimental wonder..

1.0,8-12,The best italian film in 60's
1.0,8-12,"A movie that ventures into the deepest and darkest sentiments of a filmmaker in a humourous way. With felliniesque visuals, disconnected scenes and superfluous symbolism, the whole is even more magical than the sum of its parts in a square root. It comes to an 8 1/2."
1.0,8-12,"Not my favorite, but probably the best movie about filmmaking ever made."
1.0,8-12,Fellini's dreams and reality of the cinema put onto film is perfection. Features an incredible performance by Marcello Mastroianni as the pivotal character embodying an artist at the peak of their career. One of the great films about directing films.

1.0,8-12,Really quite amazing to watch. Its certainly an odd movie. but the scenes come together beautifully

1.0,8-12,"The most celebrated fellini's film, An aparently semi-bio, is more than one of the most elocuent,imaginative and vibrant films in cinema history...is a celebration to style and fantasy."
1.0,8-12,"joins the greats, like Citizen Kane and Days of Heaven, of all films. the overly use of fantasy-grotesque sequences becomes an addict for the usual audience."
1.0,8-12,I wish there were 6 star options... cause this movie would get it. Perfect in everyway.
1.0,8-12,A staggering psychological exploration of creative discord and the very fabric of genius. Awe-inspiring art. Bellissimo. 10/10

1.0,8-12,"Easily one of the best films about filmmaking, if not, the best."
1.0,8-12,Fellini's brilliant beginning of what is known for his genius in the film industry. The movie leaves you confused and at the same time full of thought. It's not a movie you will watch over and over again but it will blow your fucken mind.
1.0,8-12,"Fellini's gift to future generation filmmakers, a movie that consists entirely of master scenes edited together to create a true masterpiece."
1.0,8-12,"Fellini's gift to future generation filmmakers, a movie that consists entirely of master scenes edited together to create a true masterpiece."
1.0,8-12,Way to go flixster. Fellini came back from the dead to film and release 8 1/2 in 1999. Way to go you yutzes.

1.0,8-12,"Like La Dolce Vita, but more introspective, this film is still a relevant statement about fame and celebrity."
1.0,8-12,"An autobiographical tour-de-force of directorâ??s block, misogyny and Catholicism. One of most unique, best looking and craziest films ever made. This universally regarded masterpiece pre-dated the work of Kauffman by decades but demonstrates similar themes and ideas."

1.0,8-12,My favourite Fellini film. Visually beautiful and extravagant.
1.0,8-12,"""Accept me as I am. Only then can we discover each other."""
1.0,8-12,Un classique Fellinien...

1.0,8-12,No wonder it's considered Fellini's magnum opus.
1.0,8-12,Amazing Movie .. really a great unique masterpiece...
0.0,8-12,"Uninspired, self-indulgent and overrated. I hate it. The worst movie ever made. And you probably wouldn't even believe me if I told you why."
1.0,8-12,"Not only one of Fredrico Fellini's best movies, but easily the best film ever made about the film industry. Every single frame is a beautiful work of art."
1.0,8-12,Una obra maestra!...
1.0,8-12,"con la hermosa fotografÃ­a de Gianni di Venanzo y un extraordinario Marcello Mastroianni, Federico Fellini logra una cinta soberbia, honesta y muy personal; me gustÃ³ mucho la escena de inicio, el diÃ¡logo con Claudia Cardinale y, por supuesto, los flash-backs a la infancia de Guido..."
1.0,8-12,"A fascinating insight into the creative mind and the demands, justifications and obligations to talent and inspiration."
1.0,8-12,Fellini's self-refferential masterpiece give the cinema its Hamlet.

0.0,8-12,"This is gonna sound like heresy since this is supposed to be ""one of the best movies of all time"", but I did not like this ""classic"" at all. Pretentious artsy fartsy crap."
1.0,8-12,"what's the feeling, when you were happy with guilty?"
1.0,8-12,"Beautifully crafted and totally confusing. Guaranteed to leave your head spining. Some of the most striking and memorable moments in cinema history."" Enough of symbolism and these escapist themes of purity and innocence"" absolute genius!"
1.0,8-12,I cannot do this movie justice with words.
1.0,8-12,Semi-autobiographical masterpiece
1.0,8-12,As good as everybody says it is.
1.0,8-12,(ITALY 1963 -Federico Fellini-)
1.0,8-12,One of the ten finest films ever made.
1.0,8-12,"A unique Fellini picture with a stunning cast about a confused, frustrated artist. Incredibly personal and realistic, this is Italian cinema at its best."
1.0,8-12,Amazing movie. Was great even with all the wonderful things I'd heard about it. I was not disappointed.
1.0,8-12,Fellini speaks the language of intellectual cinema and whether we really need the system of it when we ourselves are hypocritical in all senses of life.
1.0,8-12,Fellini's masterpiece
1.0,8-12,I'm going to need to give it a second viewing. There's so much going on in this movie. Loved it though.
1.0,8-12,Love movies about movies when they're this well done.
1.0,8-12,"Self-Indulgent, sexist, adolescent and gloriously cinematic. The more I see it the more I love it."
1.0,8-12,"Fellini's a genius. One of the more original, brilliantly made films ever."
1.0,8-12,todos deberÃ­an tener la oportunidad de ver esta pelÃ­cula
1.0,8-12,"A cinematic masterpiece. Fellini is a genius, for making such a legendary movie about a guy who can't make a movie. This is an instant favorite."
1.0,8-12,Wow... wow... wow...O_O
1.0,8-12,"I can tell that this is a movie that is going to get richer with every repeat viewing. Capturing the anxieties of the filmmaking process, Fellini has made one of the most bizarre and interesting stories about the creation of art."
1.0,8-12,The harem scene is a beautiful film classic!
1.0,8-12,My little 2 cents wont make much of a differece how briliant this film is.
1.0,8-12,"The perfect film. Full of beautiful women, sharp lighting, gorgeous shots and fragile humanity."
1.0,8-12,"Completely engrossing and beautiful story. Great script. Acting is very well done.Fellini sure knew how to pick his women.Awesome movie, watch!!"
1.0,8-12,The greatest work of art about the pressures of the artist regarding works of art
1.0,8-12,"I don't really like Fellini, but this, and La Strada, surprised me; 100% engrossing and brilliantly realized."
1.0,8-12,its absurdity was spectacular!
1.0,8-12,Larger-than-life ideas spawn what many consider is one of the best movies ever made. This inspired many other great movies. May be the king of all Italian movies.
1.0,8-12,"A *MUST* see, but late at night, with no phone calls. Put the kids to sleep and just chill.Probably the most striking, poetic film of all time! An inspiration for filmmakers and cinema for all time."
1.0,8-12,"Just wow. I was expecting one of the most overrated movies ever, but it is not. It deserves all the praise it has gotten. The performances, script, direction, all amazing. It might just be my favorite movie of all time."
1.0,8-12,Poetry in motion. Sublime.
1.0,8-12,"One of my all-time favorite films, and probably my favorite Fellini film. A movie with wonderful surreal imagery, thought-provoking existential and non-linear plotline, and a fantastic score by Nino Rota. One of the greatest films ever made."
1.0,8-12,"Reality, dreams and fantasy are never explained as if it were explicit in the experience. This is in the best 5 movies ever made and perhaps the most beautiful B&W; movie ever."
1.0,8-12,"Una pelicula sobre una pelicula o sobre la vida misma. Las mujeres jamas entenderan cual es la esencia de esta pelicula que brota testosterona por todas partes, acerca del bloqueo masculino, la frustracion masculina y la ensonacion masculina en todos los sentidos posibles de estos conceptos."
1.0,8-12,What a masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,8-12,"In Fellini's own words, ""Beautifully confused""."
1.0,8-12,It was maybe the most important movie for me in studying moviescience! I remember the lecture on italian film and the sequences from otto e mezzo. It was something special I had never seen before ... So I did my thesis about Fellini ...
1.0,8-12,Such a beautiful film. A perfect entrance to Fellini's extraordinary career.
1.0,8-12,"Very well directed, great cinematography, and Guido is a great character; he's very sympathetic, well acted, and has the coolest glasses and sunglasses around"
1.0,8-12,"A masterpiece in ways I can't describe, but must see again soon in order to elaborate upon."
1.0,8-12,"Intense, mind-engaging and deeply personal depiction of what it takes to be a filmmaker. I watch this film every time I have problems with creativity."
1.0,8-12,Another Top Ten Favourite for me. Marcello Mastroianni was the Italian character actor with all the flawless charisma and technique of Cary Grant. Fellini is genius- period. And this film is the smoothest of Fellini's surreal landscapes with the most emotional bumps.
1.0,8-12,If you have not seen this then you do not know film.I've seen it on my birthday and it just shattered everything i thought i knew about filmmaking or storytelling. Its a masterpiece
1.0,8-12,The rare occurrence when a film lives up to the years of expectation heaped upon its shoulders is something to remember. What can I add that has not already been said about this film? It is magnificent. It also features the most beautiful cast of women I have ever seen.
1.0,8-12,One of the best films ever made. As profound an experience there is to be had in cinema.
1.0,8-12,Visionary film and director; some of cinema's greatest dream sequences.
1.0,8-12,"God knows, how many times I watched this film...like many, many times...lost count..."
1.0,8-12,Awesome writing. The pinnacle of avant-garde filmmaking.
1.0,8-12,"The greatest fantasy in the history of film. It's also a vey mystical film because it speaks directly to my sub-conscious. And also, one can just relax and wallow in the fun of it."
1.0,8-12,"trippiest movie ever made? perhaps not, but for the mainstream viewer, yes, yes it is."
1.0,8-12,One of greatest movies I have ever seen!
1.0,8-12,Way back when...upon watching the first five minutes I finally realized someone else saw life the same way I did. Took my breath away.
1.0,8-12,Another flawless classic from Fellini. A lot of the deeper allegories were lost on me but the film is genuinely fun to watch and skillfully paced.
1.0,8-12,"This is the best film I've ever seen in my whole life. From the beginning until the very last second, it has ""brilliant"" written all over it.The film itself is beautiful. The pacing is also perfect."
1.0,8-12,Truly the greatest achievement in cinematic history!
1.0,8-12,non e' al primo posto solo perche' sono romagnolo...
1.0,8-12,"MUCH MUCH MUCH better than La Dolce Vita! I can now say that Fellini really is a fantastic, brilliant storyteller!"
1.0,8-12,Has to be my favorite of all time. No question. Stunning and poignant. Just everything a film should be.
1.0,8-12,Maybe the greatest movie of all time...
1.0,8-12,So tasty tasty tasty movie....
1.0,8-12,Like Shakespeare...watch it twice to get it once.
1.0,8-12,A foreign film for people who don't like foreign films. Art doesn't get any better or more breathtaking than this.
1.0,8-12,How can you go wrong with a protagonist named Guido?
1.0,8-12,"Not for everyone. First time I saw it I didn't understand it, but the film looked beautiful. But after rewatching it and take the time to really absorb it, you'll be rewarded for its endless creativity and thoughtful examination of humanity."
1.0,8-12,Fellini balances playful and dramatic storytelling without one compromising the other. Throw in Mastroianni and Cardinale and you got one beautiful film.
1.0,8-12,One of the moust inspirational movies I have ever seen.
1.0,8-12,"The most brilliant autobiographical work in film. Reflective, poetic, a showcase of Fellini's art and wizardry. Mastroianni is perfect in alter-ego performance."
1.0,8-12,Lives up to its reputation
1.0,8-12,**Fellini s masterpiece** the man who cant love...
1.0,8-12,Brilliant and crazy film about a director trying to reconcile his life. Images really jump out at you in this one.
1.0,8-12,Fellini... sei sempre il megliore
1.0,8-12,Outstanding film. Really hypnotic & fascinating.
1.0,8-12,"the greatest italian film? It is quite possible. The story itself is nothing great but it is the depth of each of the characters, along with some of cinema's most memorable shots that make this truly great."
1.0,8-12,"This film is highly poetic in its presentation, emitting the same degree of intensity as any of James Joyce's best writings. A must-watch."
1.0,8-12,"I swear, this film is what is inside my head, more than any other movie I've ever seen.  In my opinion, this is Fellini's best (although La Dolce Vita is a very close second), and this is hands-down Mastroianni's best performance."
1.0,8-12,"what an amazing journey into the middle-aged man's psyche...but if you watch it with the sound off, the visuals are purely breath-taking (even Fellini played with the idea in the opening scene, so why not?)...a cinematic treasure!"
1.0,8-12,A must see for anyone who needs inspiration by something completely visually stimulating.
1.0,8-12,Truly a miraulus masterpiece. A director who just couldn't figure out what to do with his movie makes a movie about a director who doesn't know what to do with his movie. This is a must see for any type of moviegoer.
1.0,8-12,"I didn't catch it all in the first viewing, but a very subtle film about love, life, and family. The main character is very rich in layers as he goes through his life."
1.0,8-12,i've been watching this movie for as long as i can remember and i never try to analyze it but rather just feel it as it unfolds. fellini is like no other and has always kept me guessing. mesmerizing
1.0,8-12,"A ravishing compendium of sights, sounds, and performances in a film that has the great Federico Fellini turn creative block into transcendent art. Not to be ignored."
1.0,8-12,Cinema has Ended here!
1.0,8-12,"A masterpiece , Love how Fellini plays with the medium in this one."
1.0,8-12,Kuvan ja ajatuksen liitto. Ajattomia pohdintoja ja kuvia. Fellinin ironia tekee 8Â½:sta myÃ¶s syntisen hauskan.
1.0,8-12,Don't think I will ever finish this movie... absolutly fantastic!!
1.0,8-12,"I agree with Ebert. Film is about images. If all you want is story, go read a book. If you feel the same way, then this is a masterpiece."
1.0,8-12,"Sure, I may be a Fellini junkie, but I never get tired of this flick. Just the way the camera moves through this story is dreamy. Quite a journey!"
1.0,8-12,Fellini was a ridiculously good director and this is a ridiculously good film. I can only think of a couple that I like better than this one. Easily one of the greatest ever made.
1.0,8-12,"Ultimately, this is a really funny movie. It's obvious from a lot of the reviews here that many people don't know a comedy when they see one."
1.0,8-12,This is such a cool movie in so many ways.
1.0,8-12,Si esta no es la mejor pelicua de la historia pega en el palo.La genialidad de Fellini en su maxima expresion.Si de verdad les gusta el cine estan obligados a ver este film y las demas joyas de Federico.
1.0,8-12,"Mental opening, the best ever portrayal of a dream I've ever seen. Great."
1.0,8-12,"A masterpiece of all time, no more words. Strong charachters and Fellini's ability to ride us to a thick border between reality and fantasy. I finally understood the strong influences with T. Gilliam's Brazil."
1.0,8-12,"The more and more great movies I see, the more and more I realize how much of a mark 8 1/2 has made on my life; one that no other movie can accomplish for me."
1.0,8-12,Do you know how to love?
1.0,8-12,Classic! An Original! The cinematography has been copied over and over. Fellini's Finest

1.0,8-12,This film shows the metaphorical possibilities of film.
1.0,8-12,le finale de ce film me fait tjs pleurer...
1.0,8-12,One of the greatest movies of all times. Inspired me in so many ways.
1.0,8-12,This is possibly one of the greatest movies of all time
1.0,8-12,"By blurring the lines between dreams, memories, and the present, Fellini produces the most accurate reproduction of the experience of life ever to be captured on film. If you've ever wondered what it's like to have other people call you an artist, this film will let you live it."
1.0,8-12,The opening scene...wow. It sets a great symbol for the rest of the film. I love how the transitions between reality and surrealism become less and less clear as the film progresses.
1.0,live_die_repeat_edge_of_tomorrow,This movie was an intense blend of action and interesting ideas. I love it.

1.0,live_die_repeat_edge_of_tomorrow,One of the best and most entertaining films ever.
1.0,live_die_repeat_edge_of_tomorrow,"I love the whole concept and idea of the movie. It was almost like watching a real life video game where Cruise's character had unlimited lives.I wish it didn't have so much CGI because it kind of takes away from the realness of it all, but then again this move is science fiction so yeah."

1.0,live_die_repeat_edge_of_tomorrow,"This will always be the #1 movie in my heart. Tom Cruise's acting, the plot and action just blew me away.
