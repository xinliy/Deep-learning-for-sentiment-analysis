0.0,I painfully made it through the whole movie. It is now on the top ten worst movie list. I found it boring and annoying. The acting resembled something you'd watch with a homemade movie but quite possibly worse. I do not recommend this movie for anyone.
0.0,It's as bad as the reviews indicate. I laughed once. The charisma of the two stars is completely wasted.
0.0,"This film is absolutely terrible. The script is awful, and so are the performances. There isn't even a single funny moment. Skip this one at all costs!"

0.0,"I only saw the first 10 minutes of this movie, but that was such a sad experience I had to turn it off. A waste of Witherspoon's talent. Wish I could give this 0 stars."
1.0,Reese and Sofia did amazing in this movie
0.0,It's a female buddy road trip picture and it's terrible. Sofia Vergara's amazing melons are about the only thing worth watching and even they can't redeem this shitslopper. Don't waste your time.
0.0,Really bad version of the heat
1.0,"loved, loved, loved it.Those two together are so hilarious. I would watch it a million Times and laugh beginning to end each time."
0.0,"Hot Pursuit is like a really long, egregiously unfunny SNL skit. Reese Witherspoon was just nominated for an Oscar for Wild. Watch that movie instead. Steer VERY CLEAR of Hot Pursuit. It's not worth it."
0.0,The best part was when the ex-Eastenders actor appeared
0.0,"This is one of the worst comedies I've seen this year, and it's definitely one of the worst movies I've seen this year! 0.5/5 stars."
0.0,This movie is a waste of your time and money. STAY AWAY
0.0,"This is exactly what you do not want to see in a female comedy. With the ""humor"" rooted in depicting women doing things women do not traditionally, there is a limit on what can be seen as funny. Hot Pursuit finds this limit almost immediately."

1.0,"People need to calm down and just laugh! I have never laughed so hard during a movie! Me an my friend both agree it was hilarious. Not every movie has to be Oscar worthy, sometimes it's fun to laugh at goofy comedy. Stop analyzing and have fun! That's what this movie is about."
0.0,"Possibly the worst tripe I have had the displeasure of watching this year. The jokes do not work, the chemistry between the leads feels forced and flat! The script and plot are god awful ..:: avoid like the plague"
0.0,bad don't waste your time
0.0,Terrible movie. I'll never get the time back I just wasted watching it.
0.0,A candidate for worst film in 2015. Reese Witherspoon and Sofia Vegara do a lot of acting in this over-the-top attempt at comedy. Too bad it is the wrong kind of acting. There are painfully unfunny scene after scene and the actresses are embarrassing to watch.
0.0,Not that many funny parts . Sad movie and a waste of money.

0.0,Not funny. Run as far away as you possibly can.
0.0,save yourself the trouble and sit in a hot bath with some candles for an hour.
0.0,"Hot Pursuit is supposedly an action comedy film, although it is far from both, as this film offers little to no laughs at all, and completely mediocre action scenes. Reese Witherspoon's voice alone is somewhat cringeworthy, although her opposite, Sofia Vergara, does her best to deliver."
1.0,This movie made me continually laugh!!
0.0,Armed and sort of dangerous.
0.0,A horrible way to spend 84 minutes. Simply devoid of laughs or smiles or producing anything that isn't a frown. I pray that Witherspoon's career never sinks as low as this again and that this is removed from screens as soon as possible to prevent further torture.
0.0,One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Both leads seem forced and trying to hard to be funny. Struggled to watch it to the end
0.0,Hot Pursuit is a painfully unfunny film. It is a bad ripoff of The Heat. None of the jokes land and the plot is very predictable. This is a poor movie that you shouldn't watch.
0.0,"Not that I say a Oscar nominees shouldn't take a comedy, but this is the kind of movie so called ""the script write funny""."
0.0,"This movie is pretty bad. Didn't even get to the end, and have no intention of trying to."

0.0,Contender for worst movie in history?
0.0,"It really is your typical Cop+Fugitive Road Trip story, with some attempts at comedy thrown in. We've seen this tired tale flop on the big screen countless times before, and Hot Pursuit is no different. The movie was headed for the gutter as soon as it began."

0.0,How bad was this movie? REALLY FREAKIN BAD.
0.0,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. The only scene I loved in the movie was when Christopher Walken was in the one scene. Christopher Walken was the only redeeming factor. Apart from his scene, the rest of the movie is crap."
0.0,Definitely as bad as advertised. I don't buy Affleck and Lopez has mob enforcer and the dialogue is AWFUL. Only watch this to remind yourself what truly bad movies are.

0.0,si hubiera menos una estrella seria esa su calificaci車n
1.0,"Love this movie, one of the best of the 21st century."
0.0,"Not as bad as you've heard, but close, with obnoxious characters (Affleck is particularly annoying) and a very poor script. Kazan, Walken and Pacino provide the film with its only bright moments, relatively speaking, but even they can help this turkey."
0.0,"Wildly acclaimed as one of worst movies of all time, it unfortunately lives up to it's lack of hype."
0.0,I tried watching this. I really did. Beyond awful does not even begin to capture this thing.
0.0,Some of the worst dialogue ever written for a movie.
0.0,"Another film that doesn't allow a 0 star rating system. This film was the ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" of It's time, except Plan 9 was classic..."
0.0,I'm glad affleck rose above this. His acting in this movie was some of the worst I've ever seen.
0.0,A career ending movie!
0.0,When people say this is one of the worst movies of all time .... believe them.
0.0,One of the only Ben Affleck movies I hate. It was pretty bad. There were a few good one-liners but mostly it was crap.
0.0,"I saw this movie because it had such a bad reputation. It is the worst movie, not just in the history of cinema, but also the worst piece of drama, since the dawn of time. I gave it half a star because in came in a DVD case........."
0.0,The things you have heard about this film are true.
0.0,As bad as its reputation would lead you to believe.
0.0,I am a Ben Affleck fan so reviewing this beyond a star rating would be cruel.
0.0,My most hated film of all time.
0.0,Is there a way to give this a 1/4 a star?
0.0,Horrible Horrible Horrible movie. Her lecture about why the vagina is lovely is the dumbest scene in the movie.
1.0,"this movie rocks! to call it a movie would be an insult to its sheer brilliance and cinematic prowess, this is the definition of a true film, on par with some of the greatest films of the modern era"
0.0,"Ridiculous in its premise, vomit inducing in its sentimentality and everyone involved should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves. It's like the screen plays for Chasing Amy and Midnight Run we're spliced together by someone on Ketamine."
0.0,This movie was horrible.
0.0,One of the worst movies I've ever seen.
0.0,"...If you don't think this movie is a horrifying, brutal, torture-filled experience, you haven't seen it...but please don't for the love of God ever see it"
0.0,One Word :eeeeeaaaaooooouuuueeeeaaaaaaaguuuuuuuraaaaaghhhh!
0.0,movie fucking sucks.
0.0,"Incredibly stupid and surprisingly bad movie, I actually think Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez are great actors/actresses but they deserve a whole lot better than this piece of crap."
0.0,"Where Ben Afleck once was and JLo still is. This is the type movie that should be banned from being released. This movie gets a half star since I am sure Ben got him some a**, so you can't blame they guy."
0.0,"Yeah, I needed to try a viewing because I felt a little bad for it. Until I watched it."
0.0,Hahaha! The part where they have sex WITH CLOTHES is so funny!!The only good thing of this movie is the performance of Justin Bartha.

0.0,"I finally checked out this movie, and it did not disappoint, it was horrible. Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez were miscast and the dialogue was extremely painful: ""gobble, gobble."" The scenes with Walken and Pacino were like scenes from some other movie spliced into this one."
0.0,Probably the worst movie ever made. Pediod.
0.0,"""It's Turkey Time... Gobble Gobble""  Quite possibly the worst line of dialogue ever uttered on-screen."
0.0,one of the worst movies ever!!!! painful and insulting to sit through. no wonder lopez's and affleck's career are in the crapper. can you believe al pacino was in this? plus it was directed by the dude who made scent of a woman. something went wrong here.
1.0,It'll change your life.
0.0,"Truly awful. I watched it thinking that it can't be as bad as it was made out to be, but it was! Terrible story, awful acting, woeful dialogue, I could go on and on but I'll cut it short, simply because if I don't I'll go in to detail on why every scene if abysmal."
0.0,It's films like these that make me question why the stars were stars to begin with. A thin story fueled by a mediastorm we remember as Bennifer. It's a shame that good money was thrown down the rabbit hole on garbage like that.
1.0,"It may not be the best of Affleck and Lopez's movies, but just such a crack up"
0.0,Can't speak... so evil.... repressed memories of BLEUGH!

1.0,HILARIOUS... even if unintended.
0.0,"Quite worthy of all the scorn heaped upon it. Incredibly lame. One thing that baffles me though: you can imagine z-grade actors like Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez being in something this crap, but what the hell were Al Pacino and Christopher Walken thinking?"
1.0,"Although I never saw it, I would have to put it on my movies of the decade for the sole reason that it united us in a strong dislike of Ben Afleck."
0.0,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!
0.0,I hate the fact that Al Pacino was in this horrific movie.

0.0,"So horrifyingly bad, it's entertaining"
0.0,The one good thing about this is that it more or less ended Ben Affleck's career.
0.0,I can't believe someone trusted either of these two with monologues!!!!
1.0,Watched it with no sound. Jenniger Lopez is hot.

0.0,honestly. the WORST movie ive ever seen.

0.0,"Dear god, what the hell was that?"
0.0,"I'm not really sure where to start with this one...I suppose that this movie will prove to Hollywood that attaching attractive ""actors"" to a bullshit movie won't make it a hit."
0.0,Oh My God! I'd rather watch vomit congeal!

0.0,"I hated it. Ben Affleck's character was absolutely irredeemable. The acting was fine, I just hated the plot and the characters. I found Afleck's character completely offensive."
0.0,possibly the worst film i ever half assed watched
0.0,"This movie is one example that both Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez can't act. This movie didn't suck because they were dating, it suced because they are pretty bad actors."
0.0,"Shitness from go to whoa. A hitman falling in love with a lesbian assassin? Dear god, HELP US ALL! And to think they wanted to get married in real life. Truly tragic stuff."

0.0,This movie requires negative stars!!!
0.0,This isn't THE worst movie ever...but when I saw this on T.V I realized it was really awkward. Part of the reason why a lot of people dislike Gigli is because of Benifer. They were an awful couple.

0.0,This movie turned me off of Benifer forever
0.0,"this was terrible, but it's just a bit better than ""the worst movie ever"" like most people say."
0.0,"If I could give zero stars, I would. This is an insult to film as an art. There is no coherent plot, the dialogue is dreadful and offensive, and the soundtrack sounds like the rejected B-sides from The Lion King 2. I actually felt physically ill watching only 1 hour of it."
0.0,"Terrible terrible movie. We all know how bad Jennifer Lopex and Ben Affleck are, but the really sad part is watching Al Pacino getting involved in this kind of outright crap."
0.0,Bennifer never sunk so low. Their onscreen chemistry was lukewarm at most. I can't believe that they were an item in real life you don't believe it on screen. We could also have used maybe some plot or storyline any would do.

1.0,"Scarlett Johansson and Tokyo skylines, what more could you want?"

1.0,Great movie with good performances from Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson
1.0,Sofia Coppola se revela como una gran directora y Bill Murray y Scarlett Johnasson nos entregan unas actuaciones fuera de serie. Un tono perfecto y un ritmo absorbente convierte a esta pelicula en un cl芍sico instant芍neo acerca de lo que se gana y lo que se pierde en una relaci車n.

0.0,"Hard to watch, entire time I wondered when him and Scarlett were going to fuck. Did they?"

1.0,Sofia Copplia's Lost in Translation is the greatest film of all time in my opioun because it shows that why these films are made and how it can be important to people. Bill Murray gives his best performence ever in his carrer.

1.0,"pretty blatant racism & american nationalist agenda aside, this is a remarkably well-made film."

1.0,"If I told you Bill Murray could play a character so subtle and sentimental, that the comedy of the film strengthens the films overall artwork, it would be hard to believe. But it has been done. Scarlett Johansson was also phenomenal, and it was a shame she wasn't nominated for an Oscar."

1.0,Getting lost never felt so good!
1.0,She'll probably never top this or Virgin Suicides.
1.0,"Second viewing nearly a decade later, and I find it difficult to express how this film resonates with me. A story about unrequited attraction/love that is a film of contradictions; funny, melancholic, bittersweet, wistful, serious. Its power and pathos cannot be understated."

0.0,"Boring. Not Bill Murrays finest, not even mediocre."

1.0,One of the most interesting movies I've ever seen.

1.0,Flawlessly observant.
1.0,"Plot a little predictable, but Gandolfini and Louis-Dreyfus made me not care!"
1.0,This was incredibly entertaining; a bittersweet reminder of a genuine acting talent. You can't help but think that this is the perfect movie to serve as the ending to Gandolfini's career. It shows you just how far he can stray from the persona for whom he will most be remembered. Awesome.
1.0,A really cute movie that leaves you with much to ponder!
1.0,James Gandolfini was excellent.

1.0,"original and refreshing, great movie"
1.0,Great date movie for married couples!

0.0,This movie was complete shit.
1.0,Wonderfully done comedy - drama has more to it than one might think. The nastiness of the job being done by Clooney and his pupal may turn off those who have been fired by such characters. On Blu-Ray.
1.0,A fantastic cast with a terrific script that is enhanced by good direction makes Up in the Air one of the few movies that invokes your emotions and effectively leaves you pondering long after the credits roll.
1.0,Love this movie - truly captures the Great Recession.
0.0,"One of the most boring movies I've ever seen. One of the most disappointing, plotless movies I've ever seen. It's amazing the score is over 10%."

1.0,You think you have life all figured out. And then you don't...
0.0,Anna Kendrick is excellent. Clooney is awful. There is no real conclusion or proper ending to the movie. i watched the end 4 times and still had no conclusion. Bad directing and writing. I do not like movies with the Ugly Clooney.
1.0,"A great film with smartly written characters and great performances from the cast. It's a pleasure to watch something that is witty, smart, and at the same time emotionally poignant. Credit to Clooney for delivering a spot on performance here, and of course to Jason Reitman for making great cinema."

1.0,Exceptional production of this movie!
1.0,Good movie! Oh and I love you Anna Kendrick! :*
1.0,"George Clooney gives us one of his finest moments as traveling tyrant, whose job it is to fire workers from business big and small-and getting smaller. A realistic story and a powerhouse cast make this film, undeniably, an important and resonant piece of cinema in today's economy and world."

1.0,Cant wait. Clooney is so cool.

1.0,"Geweldige film die je verweesd achterlaat. Je lacht bij aanvang, maar op het einde weet je eigenlijk niet meer waarom."
1.0,Cannot believe I went so long without seeing this film. Not the biggest Clooney fan but the acting in the film is amazing and a killer plot that leaves me pitying the lives of the characters by the end.
1.0,"A wonderful movie, led by charismatic performances by its three leads, with a smart blend of humor and emotion."
0.0,"Another boring movie that drags on forever. I'd pass on watching. This movie is ""fired"" so to say. Lol."
1.0,"Hard truths, funny trip to get there, all made enjoyable by great script smart direction and engaging performances."
1.0,"Vague message about career choice and relationship, but it makes you think. Basically, figure out who Iam and what i want to do/be then decide work/relationship I want to have"
1.0,A good movie starring Goerge Clooney. Basically it's about career choice and relationship. I like how the message is vague but makes you think about it.

1.0,"Loved this one. Can't decide if it is more comedy or drama, but it is from start to finish good. George Clooney is wonderful as Ryan Bingham who's life is in fact Up in the Air. The characters are real and story interesting. Great job by Jason Reitman."
1.0,"A really well-done film with a story that is both sweet and bitter simultaneously. A great ""sign-of-the-times"" movie. It also is one of the most realistic romances put on film in a while."
1.0,"I'm a sucker for anti-mainstream dramas, and this movie is just about great."
1.0,A rom-com that is much more than just a rom-com. Up in the air is directed by Juno director Jason Reitman and stars hollywood hunk George Clooney. 5\5 Excellent.
1.0,Up in the Air is a great american movie.
1.0,"fantastic movie. one of my favorites. no special effects. no ""action"". no eye candy. a simple adult movie exploring complex adult themes: loss, vanity, courage, ambition, fear, hope. it has it all wrapped in a fairly light package. should have won best picture. watch it and enjoy."

1.0,"Only with three scarse years of life, this movie became a classic. Its treatment of personal relationships, physcology, attitude in life.George Clooney as I've never ever seen before. Huge"
1.0,"Amazing performance from the three leads and a much more subtle performance than Bateman usually gives. Smart, funny, and has a surprising amount of heart."
1.0,It's much scarier than a horror movie that hold my nerves and makes me think of the reality. We are not definitely swans but sharks!
1.0,Anna Kendrick is amazing
0.0,"Mediocre movie. It was well acted I'll give it that but it had no real message to the story. Ultimately about a selfish guy, who doesn't really do any good in the world, and subcharacters that are unlikable. And depressing"

1.0,"One of the best, if not the best movie I have watched. It is smart, emotional, cocky at times, and finally, a sad realization of the real world we are living in. It is a movie with a discriminating take on life that probably even some grown ups would find hard to appreciate."
1.0,"Sin duda jason reitman aplico todo su esfuerzo para que esta pelicula romantica progresara con un elenco de primera, en mi punto es una de las pocas peliculas con un buen guion. La emocion de esta pelicula te hace hasta ver las estrellas."

1.0,Best soundtrack ever.
1.0,"Every time I watch Up in the Air, I always see something new. Some little nuance of the characters, or some tiny line of dialogue that changes how I previously saw the film. And each time I watch it, it gets better. I don't see any reason that this film should get any less than 5/5 stars."

0.0,One of the most uninteresting films I have ever seen.
0.0,"Boring, pointless and totally unoriginal and cliched, this only gets the slightest of interest because of Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman once again teaming up on screen. Ultimately it sucks big time"
0.0,"from the beginning i was bored and angry, i quit 50 mins in."
0.0,You can barely call this 90 minute apple commercial a movie. It is terrible. Another example that Liam Hemsworth can't carry his own film. He is extremely unlikable in this. What are Ford and Oldman doing in this train wreck?
0.0,Garbage! The title doesn't even make sense once you sit through this mumbled mess...just a reason to see Liam in a nice suit and what a waste of Gary oldman talent
0.0,Very bad acting. Very bad story. Surprising considering the caliber of actors. Horrible movie.

0.0,This was a wretched reimagining of a great book. The book is much darker and a lot more thrilling. This is just a bunch of hippies taking on an evil corporate empire.
0.0,"Instead of watching this movie. I'd rather eat Taco Bell, puke it up, pour it in a pan, put it in the oven for 45 minutes then remove, let cool and eat the Mexican flavored puke casserole."
0.0,"A techno-thriller movie that lacks techno-thrilling. It had a good premise, but the way it was shown was terrible. Ths script was so boring and cliched that it didn't creat any tension at all. All I can say is that it was a bore of a movie."

0.0,This movie was beyond horrible -- I blame the person who green light this script
0.0,Another wasted talent for Harrison ford and anyone else in it why bother with uninteresting plot
1.0,"Not really sure what this movie has been rated so poorly. Paranoia is an excellent film from start to finish. Two rival companies, their creators whom were friends at first, battle for the top seat in the industry stopping at nothing to reach the top. Espionage thriller"
0.0,"Maybe it should be called Underwhelma.... seriously Liam has no screen presence, a slice of Ham could have had the same film presence here. Sure you do get Ford and Oldman chewing the scenery up, but they're not given much to work with... terrible film"
1.0,Great movie. Worth the watch

0.0,"it was pretty much all over the place. nothing new. well, at least Hemsworth and Heard were pretty"
0.0,I went into the movie theater with a headache put left with a migraine. this movie gets sucked in to its own attempts to be clever and as result there is very litttle to understand or enjoy.
0.0,This movie is ridiculously stupid. Do not watch it. Its only redeeming factor (if you can count this as redeeming) is that the star-studded leads give categorically average performances.
0.0,WH??AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?
0.0,"No. Not even for such actors in the support as Gary Oldman, Richard Dreyfuss and Harrisson Ford. The half-star is just so I can post this on FB. I really wanted to slash my wrists after seeing this."

0.0,"La cinta tiene buenas actuaciones, incluso buena m迆sica, sin embargo es bastante aburrida, su desarrollo no le ayuda bastante, es una pel赤cula plana, sin chiste alguno, sopor赤fera, en si Paranoia no vale mucho la pena."
0.0,"This deserves every Razzie nomination for wasting Josh Holloway's time, Gary Oldman's time, Harrison Ford's time, and mine."
0.0,"Flat, lifeless, and boring, Paranoia is everything that is wrong with most big-budget, star-packed thrillers."
1.0,Very nicely done. Good story and acting
0.0,"Gary and Harry, why?"
0.0,Boring. Stupid. The opposite of sexy.

0.0,Worst movie I have seen in the theater this year by far. I wanted my money back (and I seen it for free btw). Theres no place to begin about the gargantuan f#@%up that is this movie.
1.0,I really enjoyed this movie Gary Oldman is always great no matter what.

0.0,why did I trust a movie with only two critics liked it at a moment
0.0,Bad dialogue coupled with poor acting and a plot that's totally cliche'
0.0,"Even Gary Oldman can't save this one. TERRIBLE adaptation of the novel. Even if Luketic claims it was 'fine' with the author, it's not 'fine' with most of the audience, including those of us who understand a movie can never stay completely true to a book. A travesty of directing, and screen writing."
0.0,"Don't even bother. Acting is unreliable, plot is artificial, technology references are stupid, and generally the whole movie is one big yawn. I have never watched such a redundant film as this one."

0.0,"The Book of Henry is one of the most misguided movies of the year, which ranges from being offensively exploitive to laughably incompetent, with terrible direction by Colin Trevorrow, and a plot that ranges from being Bridge to Terabithia to a hospital soap opera to Day of the Jackal."
0.0,THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN. It makes me not want to watch movies anymore. If I could I would give it 0 STARS. The acting was bad the plot had twist that made me think I was in the twilight zone. Also the production of the movie was terrible.

1.0,Slow burn but the last 30-40 mins are tense.
1.0,"Absolutely terrific! I remember when these events took place those many years ago. So I found it even more interesting to find out details of the release of those held captive and about Canada's involvement in their rescue! Edge of your seat exciting!

1.0,"Affleck proves (again) how much of a credible director he is...and for those who say isn't the best of actors, perhaps that's down to quality of previous scripts he has worked with. This proves that he is one of the finest actor/director's working in Hollywood today."

1.0,"Initially I wasn't interested in seeing this, however it's really worth the watch."

1.0,Was not expecting 'Argo' to be as good as it was. Unbelievably tense. Don't hesitate to watch.
1.0,"Ben Affleck just looked straight out sexy in this one, good suspense and action I give it a give for the handsome beard and long hair 70's style. Affleck one good-looking member of the beard gang."

1.0,"Absolutely fantastic, Ben affleck's best. My favourite movie of 2012"

1.0,"Very engrossing story. Even if you come into it having read the back story (as I had) it's still a very engaging story with great performances by the cast and crew alike. Hopefully, this is Ben Affleck's Oscar picture. He deserves it...for his directing, at least."
1.0,"The ending was inevitable, but the suspense was so great I was sitting on the edge of my seat for 30 straight minutes. Kind of hurt my butt honestly."
1.0,"I found nothing wrong with this nail-biting, tense, edge-of-your-seat popcorn fick; a very deserving oscar winner for Best Picture and for my favourite film list of all time!"
1.0,"Terse and tightly constructed in a way that is somewhat rare from Hollywood. It's not quite a masterpiece, but it's not the ethnocentric piece of patriotism that some critics have said it is. Affleck is a masterful director (his acting here ain't even that bad) and he shows it. Amazing movie."

1.0,"Don't expect any high action battle scenes but this movie will still keep you tense to know how the outcome of all the hard work will turn out. I don't want to give out too much of the movie but as it states, this is all based on true events. You'll see what I mean."

1.0,"Ben Affleck directs and stars in this slickly made suspense/docudrama. The intensity is balanced out by humor (at the expense of late 70s Hollywood), creating a near perfect film. With this and his previous directing/starring effort (The Town), Affleck has really come into his own."

1.0,good suspense and a great film
1.0,"Great film, great true story an kept me on the edge of my seat!"
1.0,"Despite bending the truth here and there, Argo is quite an amazing film. In fact ti is one of Ben Afflecks best director wise. It tells the story it needs to, with a lot of suspense throughout. Not to mention the A+ acting that really brings this film together."
1.0,"Finally saw this. Had seen some negative reviews which kind kept me from watching it. Honestly may be my favorite 2016 movie now. Definitely not an action movie, but such a smart thoughtful experience from beginning to end."
1.0,"Holy crap!! You need to watch it for yourself. It may start slow, but adding the pieces of the plot together along with the characters leads to a fulfilling ending."
1.0,Seen in cinema- excellent!
0.0,Awful. Turned it off after. 15-20 min
1.0,"This movie is AMAZING. It is so high quality and original. It is a lot like Interstellar, but I felt my mind being left in an intellectual stupor even more so."

1.0,"Loved it, a really interesting film"
1.0,Watched it for the 10th time today - and still gets me.
0.0,"How did this movie get such great reviews?? This movie was horrible, boring, anticlimactic and had an ending that made absolutely no sense. Waste of time."
0.0,"So...""Arrival"" was basically the 2007 Sandra Bullock movie ""Premonition"" combined with ""Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind."" Cinematically, it was pretty. Story/Plot-wise, it was predictable and boring. I fell asleep watching it."
1.0,Good for what ails us right now
1.0,A sci-fi movie about an anthropologist saving the world!! Amazing!
1.0,Just amazing! Very complex and confusing but there's a beautiful message.
1.0,"great sci-fi, great drama, great film!"
1.0,"Amazing movie, exactly what I want from sci-fi"
0.0,"Worst movie since ET. Amy Adams is helpless and hopeless. People act in completely unrealistic ways that make no sense. ""Then a miracle occurs"" is the premise of the move."
1.0,"Made me think. The ideas were intriguing, and there was kind of a plot twist / surprise in the end. A little formulaic about the reactionary nature of humans (or maybe just realistic). I loved the idea that time is nonlinear. And I want to meet those aliens!"
1.0,Very well done. Amy Adams is perfect. Best Sci-fi movie since Contact.
1.0,Give it all the praise!!! Amazing movie
1.0,"Both Villenveuve and Adams are at their best here. Visually and emotionally stunning. I am, and always will be, dumbfounded that Adams did not receive more recognition for her role in bringing this story to life. The character work and use of misdirection is peak storytelling."
1.0,WOW this is truly a SFX masterpiece!!
1.0,"A smart, expertly paced and acted sci-fi thriller. Arrival, once again, proves director Denis Villenueve is one of the modern masters of our time.5/5 stars"
1.0,A great film to leave you pondering the human experience.
1.0,one of the best scifi
0.0,This movie was TERRIBLE! How did it get such a high rating? OMG. It was slow and boring for starters. And the end was just... Dumb.
1.0,Great acting and a great story! The plot twist at the end is one of the best I've seen in a long time! A must see for Sci Fi fans!
1.0,This is a special movie. It's not an action movie. It's not a thriller. Its not singular. It's nothing so pigeon-holed. It's f-ing smart. It's beautiful. It's masterfully crafted. Stop reading this. Go watch it.
1.0,Imagine the thrill of Close Encounters combined with the awe and wonder of 2001 A Space Odyssey. Director Dennis Villeneuve and Writer Eric Heisserer are now at the top of my list of favorite directors and writers.
1.0,Sublime. Perfectly executed and a fascinating look at perceptions if reality.
1.0,"I am generally not a fan of science fiction or thrillers, but Amy Adams successfully helms this excellent film that questions our pre-conceived notions of what science fiction really can be."
1.0,"A very thought invoking, and inspiring movie. I am blown away by the script, the direction and acting."
1.0,Amazing sci-fi movie!
1.0,Arrival movie is absolutely Glorious
0.0,"What a waste of my time, confusing and utterly stupid. WTF is what came to mind at the end. I only watched all of the movie waiting for something to tie together, never did. Had lots of questions that were never answered, just like tv show Lost."

1.0,A well-executed science fiction thriller that also carries a thought-provoking concept down to its structural core.
0.0,"Best movie by far to fall asleep to! Other than that...overrated, boring, and nothing special. Wish I never saw this movie. What a waste of time and money."
1.0,Enjoyable sci-fi quasi-thriller with some familiar themes from Contact.
1.0,"Incredibly powerful movie, a true ""statement of the human condition"".This story is a Shakespearean Tragedy masquerading as a sci-fi movie. That it didn't win multiple academy awards is shameful."
0.0,Normally I agree with the tomatometer and audience score. I found this the most boring movie I have seen in a long time. I actually watched it to the end in the hope that it would redeem itself but no luck on that front.
1.0,my favorite film <3
0.0,"Incredibly pretentious. This is a ""chick flick"" disguised as sifi. The style is ridiculously slow. The concept of the aliens was very good, but the interesting part of the movie, how to understand language was skipped over. Silly movie how it got 94% ratings from the pros is a head scratcher."
1.0,"Thoughtful, emotional and very moving. Something we all think about but can't quite fathom the logistics of meeting intelligent life outside of our own. Amy Adams shines."
1.0,"Loved this movie, the plot was so brilliant and i feel like it desserved more awards."
1.0,An absurdly good contact movie made with believe communication and an incredibly dense plot. One you'll want to pay very close attention to.
1.0,Inspiring! Stunning sound effects.
1.0,For once a symbolic story that goes against the typical vilified alien invasion type plot. A beautiful message linking advance communication and precognition skills. One of the most emotionally driven sci-fi movies of all time.
0.0,"Slow, stupid plot, ridiculous ending what a waste of timeWorst movie of 2016"
0.0,What a confusing mess. This movie was loaded with suspense...and then had zero pay off. This movie is easily one of the biggest wastes of time I've seen.

1.0,"This movie is moving, well thought out, beautifully presented, and a wonderful performance but Adams. The best movie of 2016 and 2017."
1.0,"Absolutely, fantastically, interesting throughout."

1.0,"beautiful, slow in certain moments but definitely worth it for the ending!"

1.0,A fantastic movie that makes you think. Really beautifully done.
1.0,A masterclass science fiction that takes multiple viewings to truly appreciate and understand.
1.0,"Not only looks great, but remains grounded, sustaining a very human and emotional element to the science fiction genre, having a spirit all of its own."
1.0,"One of my 3 wishes, which for some reason extend to all humanity is to give everyone a common language so 'lost in translation' ceases to exist. This movie shares my desire, thought provoking and beautifully acted."
1.0,"This has been one of the best movie experiences I have ever had, the imagination and creativity the moviemakers used is excellent."
1.0,"I love a movie that keeps you thinking after its over, this movie delivers. Amy killed it and Im definetly rewatching this masterpiece."

1.0,Amazing. This movie is so innovative and interesting. The story and plot line are creative.
1.0,One of my favourite movies of all time. Amazing. Moving.
0.0,"I liked the timing and the main topic of the movie. But, the movie proceeds so slowly until the point that it was driving me crazy. I think the exact same plot with exact same acting quality could be done, half the time that this movie took (which is 111 minutes)."
0.0,"The more I reflect on it, the worse it gets."
1.0,"This movie is a masterpiece. Every line and every scene is significant and very well though/planned out. The subject matter was brilliant as well, communication...it shines a light on just how complicated it is. This is the best movie I have seen in recent memory."
1.0,Arrival is an intelligent film that gives a great performance from Amy Adams with language aspects
1.0,Fantastic. A Must see.
1.0,"Arrival is something different to the other sci-fi movies, it?s more focus on comunication and inteligence of the humans than the aliens. Amy Adams is amazing so as the story that it will blow your mind at the third act of the movie"
1.0,One of the best movies I have ever seen by far.
1.0,"Great movie!!! I am just left with questions, I'll have to watch again and get the answer!Would gladly watch a sequel if there is one!"
1.0,couldn't take my eyes off the screen. the atmosphere of this movie is truly captivating.
0.0,Not sure how this show got 93%! Was all excited to see it and boy was it a waste of time. First 45 minutes shear boredom. It was so dark I could hardly see each scene. Could have been so much better. Wish I could get me money back. Human Human Human ink blot ink blot octopus are now aliens!
1.0,"A really good movie. Im a smart person but I don't know if I'm smart enough for this movie. I really liked it, not one I'll buy but one I'll watch when ever its on to try and better understand it."
1.0,A tour-de-force. Equally riveting and revitalizing as it is meditative and poetic in its exploration of humanity.
0.0,This was easily the worst movie I have seen in a while. The boring drawn out plot that had such a poor careless ending. I literally would put this movie on any time you're having insomnia as it is guaranteed to remedy that issue. It only deserves 93% as sleeping medicine. Absolutely awful flim
1.0,"One of the most underated movies of 2016. An amazing original story, great cast and cinematography. But the music waa on another level. The actors did not have to speak, the music told the whole story."
0.0,"One of the most boring ""aliens come to earth"" movies I have ever seen. The plot is also implausible and forced. Other than some of the visual effects, the film is unwatchable."
1.0,"Simply marvelous. Excellent script, actors, everything was amazing"
1.0,It's not really a complex movie it's pretty easy to understand...it's just meh. Starts strong then gets a tad slow for a hour then gets going last 20 mins. Not really a great story but does make you think about what if you knew your future.
1.0,Smart sci-fi for adults.
0.0,Quit possibly one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time
1.0,Never thought I'd see a movie so thoughtful about Squid aliens and language. But I couldn't be happier about it.
1.0,A total tear jerker!
1.0,"Though you will see plenty of nods to past sci fi films and plenty of re-hashed themes, Arrival amply creates an amazing thought provoking sci fi with human morality. Amy Adams is on top of her game once again and once you fully grasp the film and its heady concept, you will be blown away."

0.0,"This movie absolutely sucked ass. Horrible! I lost 2 hours of my life watching this piece of trash, waiting and waiting for it to go somewhere or get remotely interesting. Great actors and acting but the plot and story of the movie were just plain shit."

0.0,Pretentious AND boring... an almost unbearable combination. I hate almost everything about Arrival.

0.0,Wasted money to see this. Uggghh
0.0,First sifi film I have ever fallen asleep to!
1.0,This is one of the best constructed movies I have ever seen. Denis Villeneuve definitely knows his shit and he has a strong understanding on craft.

1.0,What can I say? I only regret not seeing this movie sooner. If you haven't seen it please do so.
0.0,Well there's 2 hours of my life I won't get back. This movie made no sense to me and even with such good actors it was extremely boring.
0.0,"Still unsure what I just watched. Their really was nothing to gain from watching this film. Spider aliens come to Earth, one person figures out how to communicate with the aliens within days, the aliens already know English, and they leave. Oh and they get married. Waste of time."

1.0,Muy interesante e inesperada

1.0,"At first viewing - on a plane - brilliant! Ambitious and largely intelligent, it's more successful than most in bringing big themes from the world of sci-fi literature to the big screen."
1.0,Definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's mind-blowing and yet I still understood it.
0.0,Nothing happens. Aliens come to save humanity in hopes that one day humanity will save them. One woman is the key and saves both. Aliens leave. The end. No action. Incredibly slow. Nothing to engage the audience. Would never recommend to anyone.
1.0,"Arrival is a highly inspiring movie, setting up the topic of extraterrestrial visitors from a whole different point of view. The intelligent storyline and a tense yet not overly thrilling narrative make this movie a great sci-fi experience."
1.0,Arrival is a unique story that it's not just a simple sci-fi movie but an incredible journey of our human existence as well as presenting unity between people. Strong performance from Amy Adams and brilliant direction from Denis Villeneuve.

1.0,So well written and acted
1.0,"A new sci-fi favorite (with some of the most interesting bits not even being science-based)! Thought provoking. I left with a mix of emotions (in the good way).

0.0,I'm only giving this move 1/2 a star because I can't seem to give it 0 stars. It was terrible.
0.0,"Totally confusing. Impossible to understand until I read the explanation on a website afterwards. Wish I'd read that before I watched. Actually, it would not have made the movie more interesting. Probably helps if you are SERIOUSLY into strange time shifting science fiction."

1.0,Intelligent sci-fi. Amy Adams is a national treasure.
1.0,"One of the greatest, if not THE greatest movie I have seen. From the cinematography, to the storyline and the performance of the actors and actresses. This is a must see movie that will move you on a deep philosophical level."
1.0,The GOOD movie from 2016 about Amy Adams and aliens the government doesn't quite trust. Arrival is smart and stays smart all the way to the end rather than just turning into a CGI action movie in the third act like a lesser movie would have. The twist is great and it makes you think.
1.0,"Wow... this movie was basically perfect for me. Great sci fi (my writing passion), linguistics (my education), smart story, & an almost gut wrenching finale when the truth comes together & my mouth is left gaping from the mind-blowing outcome. Phenomenal movie."

1.0,"So much deeper and heartfelt than I'm sure most people expected, and that's an amazing thing. What a movie. Beautiful performance from Adams. The story and writing, the direction, the visuals....everything is so great. Villeneuve is officially my new favorite director."
0.0,This was so boring. I can't believe how bad it was. What did people see in this to rate it so well?
1.0,"Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner are phenomenal. A space movie, when you put Independence Day and Gravity together. Arrival is great and oh my god it should have won best picture because no movie has put me on a cliff hanger than this. A must see film"

1.0,Not your typical alien movie. Worth a watch.

0.0,Slow and drags on waiting for SOMETHING to happen
1.0,This is a Great movie
1.0,"Not a dull moment in this one. An incredible story that keeps you engaged the whole way through. Asks and answers some big questions. Like all time travel movies, we were able to come up with some flaws, but not until the car ride home. Absolutely go see it."

1.0,Brilliant! A movie that leaves you reflecting long after the credits roll.
1.0,Mind blowing masterpiece.

1.0,Why would the 50th anniversary of James Bond not be a great movie! This is a great film that is my favorite film in the entire James Bond franchise because it stays simple and not too complex. It also has an exciting finale like no other James Bond film
1.0,"Out of all 3 Bond films Daniel Craig was in, Skyfall is the best. I would probably say this takes the place of Golden Eye. It has psychology along with action to test his faith and strength."
